               </b> Aggālavacetiya<br/>The chief shrine at Āḷavī, originally a pagan place of worship, but later converted into a Buddhist vihāra. The Buddha stopped here on many occasions during his wanderings, and this was the scene of several Vinaya rules, e.g. against monks digging the ground <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.32</c>  and cutting trees, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.34</c>  using unfiltered water for building purposes, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.48</c>  sleeping in the company of novices, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.16</c>  giving new buildings in hand. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.172f.</c> 
               <br/>The Chabbaggiyā are censured here for a nissaggiya offence. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.224</c>  The Vaṅgīsa Sutta was preached there to Vaṅgīsa, on the occasion of the death of his preceptor, Nigrodhakappa. <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.59f.</c>  In the early years of Vaṅgīsa’s novitiate he stayed at the shrine with his preceptor, and disaffection arose within him twice, once because of women, the second time because of his tutor’s solitary habits, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.185–186</c>  and later, again, through pride in his own powers of improvisation (paṭibhāna). <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.187</c>  Here, again, the Buddha utters the praises of Hatthaka Āḷavaka, who visits him with a large following, whose fealty has been won (according to Hatthaka) by observing the four characteristics of sympathy (saṅgahavatthūni) learnt from the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.216–220</c>

                 Aggika Bhāradvāja
                <br/>A brahmin of Sāvatthī, of the Bhāradvāja clan. The Buddha, while on his rounds, sees him tending the fire and preparing oblations, and stands for alms in front of his house. The brahmin abuses him, calling him muṇḍaka and vasala. Thereupon the Buddha preaches to him the Vasala Sutta (or, as it is sometimes called, the Aggika Bhāradvāja Sutta), and wins him over to the faith. <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.21–25</c>

                <br/>A brahmin of Rājagaha, a fire-tender. He prepares a meal for sacrifice, and when the Buddha, out of compassion for him, appears before his house for alms, he says the meal is meant only for one who has the “threefold lore” (the three Vedas). The Buddha gives the brahmin another interpretation of the “threefold lore”; (see Aggika Sutta). The brahmin, thereupon, becomes a convert, enters the Order, and, in due course, attains arahantship. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.166f.</c>

               <br/>Probably the name of a brahmin clan, the Agnivesyāyanas, and the Ksatriyas who were so styled, took the name from their brahmin priests.<br/>The name is used by the Buddha in addressing Saccaka Nigaṇṭhaputta, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.229f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.237f.</c>  and also Dīghanakha Paribbājaka. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.497f.</c>

               </b>
               <br/>One of the 16 Great Nations (Mahājanapadā), mentioned in the Pitakas. The countries mentioned are Aṅga, Māgadha, Kāsī, Kosala, Vajji, Mallā, Ceti, Vaṃsa, Kuru, Pañcāla, Macchā, Sūrasena, Assaka, Avantī, Gandhāra, and Kamboja. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.213</c>

               <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.200</c> 
               <br/>It was to the east of Māgadha, from which it was separated by the River Campā, and had as its capital city Campā. Another city mentioned is Assapūra. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.271</c> 
               <br/>In the Buddha’s time the Aṅgarājā was just a wealthy nobleman, and he is mentioned merely as having granted a pension to a Brahmin. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.163</c>  The people of Aṅga and Māgadha are generally mentioned together, so we may gather that by the Buddha’s time they had become one people. They provide Uruvelā-Kassapa with offerings for his great sacrifice. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.27</c> 
               <br/>Several discourses were preached in the Aṅga country, among them being the Soṇadaṇḍa Sutta and the two Assapura Suttas. The Mahāgovinda Sutta seems to indicate that once, in the past, Dhataraṭṭha was king of Aṅga. But this, perhaps, refers to another country.<br/> Soṇa Koḷivisa, before he entered the Order, was a squire (paddhagu) of Aṅga. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.632</c>

               <br/>As a result of his deeds whole villages were deserted, and the king ordered a detachment of men to seize the bandit. Aṅgulimāla was converted by the Buddha’s power and received the “ehi bhikkhu pabbajjā” <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.868–870</c>  while the populace were yelling at the king’s palace for the robber’s life. Later, the Buddha presented him before King Pasenadi when the latter came to Jetavana, and Pasenadi, filled with wonder, offered to provide the monk with all requisites. Aṅgulimāla, however, had taken on the dhutangas and refused the king’s offer.<br/>When he entered Sāvatthī for alms, he was attacked by the mob, but on the admonition of the Buddha, endured their wrath as penance for his former misdeeds.<br/>He eased a woman’s labour pains by an act of truth. The words he used in this saccakiriyā (yato aham bhagini ariyāya jātiyā jāto) have come to be regarded as a paritta to ward off all dangers and constitute the Aṅgulimāla Paritta.<br/>In the Aṅgulimāla Sutta he is addressed by Pasenadi as Gagga Mantānīputta, his father being a Gagga.<br/>It was on his account that the rule not to ordain a captured robber was enacted. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.74</c>

               <br/>A banyan tree in Uruvelā, on the banks of the Nerañjara, near the Bodhi tree. A week after the Enlightenment the Buddha went there and spent a week cross-legged at the foot of the tree. There he met the Huhuṅkajātika Brahmin. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.2–3</c>  Two weeks later he went there again from the Rajāyatana. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.4</c>  It was then that the Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and persuaded him to preach the doctrine, in spite of the difficulty of the task. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.5–7</c>  When the Buddha wishes to have someone as his teacher, Sahampati appears again and suggests to him that the Dhamma be considered his teacher. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.20f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.138f.</c> 
               <br/>By Ajapāla-nigrodha it was, too, that, immediately after the Enlightenment, Māra tried to persuade the Buddha to die at once. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.112</c>  Several other conversations held here with Māra are recorded in the Saṃyutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.103f.</c> 
               <br/>Here, also, the Buddha spent some time before the Enlightenment. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.267</c> 
               <br/>The Brahmā Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.167</c>  and the Magga Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.185</c>  both on the four satipaṭṭhāna, and another Brahmā Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.232f.</c>  on the five indriyāni, were concerning thoughts that occurred to the Buddha on various occasions at the foot of this tree, when he sat there soon after the Enlightenment. On all these occasions Brahma Sahampati appeared to him and confirmed his thoughts. Several old brahmins, advanced in years, visited the Buddha during this period and questioned him as to whether it were true that he did not pay respect to age. To them he preached the four Thera-karaṇā dhamma. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.22</c>

               <b>
                  <c c="#a00149">Ajātasattu</c>
               </b> Vedehiputta<br/>Son of Bimbisāra, King of Māgadha, and therefore half-brother to Abhayarājakumāra. He murdered his father to gain the throne, and conspired with Devadatta to kill the Buddha, but was later converted. He had a son Udāyibhadda. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.50</c> 
               <br/>Ajātasattu was greatly impressed by Devadatta’s powers of iddhi and became his devoted follower. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.185</c>  He built for him a monastery at Gayāsīsa and waited upon him morning and evening carrying food for him, sometimes as much as five hundred cartloads in five hundred cooking pans. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.242</c> 
               <br/>Devadatta incited him to seize the throne, killing his father if necessary. When Bimbisāra learnt of the prince’s intentions he abdicated in his favour. But Devadatta was not satisfied till Bimbisāra, who was one of the Buddha’s foremost supporters, was killed.<br/>Ajātasattu helped Devadatta in several of the latter’s attempts to kill the Buddha.<br/>Later he was filled with remorse for these past misdeeds as he confesses himself; <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.85</c>  but evidently, for very shame, he refrained from visiting the Buddha till he was won over by the persuasions of his physician Jīvaka Komārabhacca. And when in the end he did go to the Buddha, it was in great fear and trembling; so nervous was he that he imagined conspirators in the very silence surrounding the Buddha where he dwelt in the monastery, in Jīvaka’s Mango grove at Rājagaha. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.49–50</c> 
               <br/>It was on the occasion of this visit that the Sāmaññaphala Sutta was preached. The king admits that he had been to various teachers before, but had failed to find satisfaction in their teachings. It is noteworthy that the Buddha greets the king cordially on his arrival and makes no mention whatever of the king’s impiety. Instead, when Ajātasattu expresses his repentance at the end of the discourse, the Buddha accepts his confession and lets him off almost too lightly. But after the king had departed the Buddha tells the monks how the king’s misdeeds had wrought his undoing both in this world and the next, for if he had not been guilty of them, the Eye of Truth would have been opened for him on the occasion of this sermon. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.85–86</c> 
               <br/>Henceforth the king became a loyal adherent of the Buddha’s faith, though, as far as we know, he never waited again either upon the Buddha or upon any member of the Order for the discussion of ethical matters. He was so full of love and respect for the Buddha that when he heard of Upaka Maṇḍikāputta having spoken rather impolitely to the Buddha, he at once flew into a rage. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.182</c> 
               <br/>Bimbisāra had married a sister of Pasenadi, and when he was killed she died of grief.<br/>The revenue of a Kāsī village had been given to her by her father, Mahākosala, as part of her dowry, but after Bimbisāra’s murder, Pasenadi refused to continue it. Thereupon Ajātasattu declared war on his uncle. Before this, uncle and nephew seem to have been on very friendly terms. Once Ajātasattu sent Pasenadi a wonderful piece of foreign fabric, sixteen cubits long and eight broad, mounted on a pole to serve as a canopy. This Pasenadi gave to Ānanda. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.116</c> 
               <br/>At first he was victorious in three battles, but, later, he was defeated by Pasenadi, who followed the military advice of an old monk, the Elder Dhanuggahatissa; Ajātasattu was taken captive with his army. On giving an undertaking not to resort to violence again, he was released, and to seal the friendship, Pasenadi gave him his daughter Vajirā as wife, and the revenue of the disputed village was gifted to her as bath-money. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.82–85</c> 
               <br/>Later, when through the treachery of Pasenadi’s minister, Dīgha Kārāyana, his son Viḍūḍabha usurped the throne, Pasenadi, finding himself deserted, went towards Rājagaha to seek Ajātasattu’s help, but on the way he died of exposure and Ajātasattu gave him burial.<br/>About a year before the Buddha’s death, Ajātasattu sent his chief minister and confidant, the brahmin Vassakāra, to the Buddha to intimate to him his desire to make war on the Vajjians and to find out what prediction the Buddha would make regarding his chances of victory. The Buddha informed the brahmin that the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of welfare which they had learnt from him, and that they were therefore invincible. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.72f.</c>  The Saṃyutta Nikāya mentions the Buddha as saying that the time would come when the Vajjians would relinquish their strenuous mode of living and that then would come Ajātasattu’s chance. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.268</c> 
               <br/>Rumours are mentioned of King Candappajjota making preparations for a war on Ajātasattu to avenge the death of his friend Bimbisāra, but no mention is made of actual fighting. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.iii.7</c> 
               <br/>It was he who built the fortress of Pāṭāliputta, which later became the capital of Māgadha.<br/>

                  <c c="#a00149">Ajitakesakambala</c>
               </b> Kesakambala Ajita<br/>Head of one of the six heretical sects mentioned in the Pitakas as being contemporaneous with the Buddha. He is described as a Titthaka (non-Buddhist teacher), leader of a large following, virtuous and held in esteem by the people. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.68</c> 
               <br/>According to the Sāmaññaphala Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.55</c>  where Ajātasattu describes a visit paid to Ajita, he taught the doctrine of “cutting off,” i.e. annihilation at death. He was a nihilist who believed in neither good nor evil. The answer Ajita gave to Ajātasattu is given elsewhere <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.207</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.515</c>  as being the view of a typical sophist. His name is often introduced into the stereotyped list of the six teachers even where the views they are alleged to have expressed do not coincide with those attributed to Ajita in the Sāmaññaphala Sutta. In the Saṃyutta <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.398</c>  he is represented as talking about the rebirths of his adherents—he who denied rebirth. In the Aṅguttara <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.286</c>  he seems to have been confused with Makkhali Gosāla. He was called Kesakambali because he wore a blanket of human hair, which is described as being the most miserable garment. It was cold in cold weather, hot in the hot, evil-smelling and uncouth.<br/>Ajita was evidently much older in years than the Buddha, for we find Pasenadi, in the early years of his friendship with the Buddha, telling him that he was a young novice compared with Ajita. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.68</c>

               </b> (1) <br/>A celebrated sage, composer and reciter of sacred runes, mentioned together with nine others (Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha and Bhagu), <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.245</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.104</c>  as the ancient sages of the brahmins. They abstained from food at unseasonable times. They were the first teachers of the Tevijja Brahmins <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.238</c>  and great sacrifices were conducted by them. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.61</c> 
               <br/>Various teachings are attributed to them, e.g. that they recognised five kinds of Brahmins—brahmasama, devasama, mariyāda, sambhinnamariyāda, and brāhmaṇacaṇḍāla. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.224ff.</c>  These sages did not claim to have discerned and realised the five qualities-truth, austerities, chastity, study and munificence—specified by the brahmins for the attainment of merit and the achievement of what is right, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.199–200</c>  though their followers behaved as if they did.

               </b>
               <br/>A banker (seṭṭhi) of Sāvatthī who became famous because of his unparalleled generosity to the Buddha. His first meeting with the Buddha was during the first year after the Enlightenment, in Rājagaha., <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.154ff.</c>  whither Anāthapiṇḍika had come on business.<br/>His wife was the sister of the seṭṭhi of Rājagaha, and when he arrived he found the seṭṭhi preparing a meal for the Buddha and his monks on so splendid a scale that he thought that a wedding was in progress or that the king had been invited. On learning the truth he became eager to visit the Buddha, and did so very early the next morning. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.155–156</c>  He was so excited by the thought of the visit that he got up three times during the night. When, at last, he started for Sītavana, the road was quite dark, but a friendly Yakkha, Sīvaka, sped him on with words of encouragement. By force of his piety the darkness vanished.<br/>The Buddha was staying in the Sītavana, and when Anāthapiṇḍika reached there spirits opened the door for him. He found the Buddha walking up and down, meditating in the cool air of the early dawn. The Buddha greeted him and talked to him on various aspects of his teaching. Anāthapiṇḍika was immediately converted and became a Sotāpanna. He invited the Buddha to a meal the next day, providing everything himself, although the seṭṭhi, the Mayor of Rājagaha and King Bimbisāra asked to be allowed to help. After the meal, which he served to the Buddha with his own hand, he invited the Buddha to spend the rainy season at Sāvatthī, and the Buddha accepted, saying “the Tathāgatas, o householder, take pleasure in solitude.” “I understand, o Blessed One, I understand,” was the reply.<br/>When Anāthapiṇḍika had finished his business at Rājagaha he set out towards Sāvatthī, giving orders along the way to his friends and acquaintances to prepare dwellings, parks, rest-houses and gifts all along the road to Sāvatthī in preparation for the Buddha’s visit. He had many friends and acquaintances and he was ādeyyavaco (his word was held to be of weight). <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.158</c> 
               <br/>Understanding the request implied in the Buddha’s words when he accepted the invitation, Anāthapiṇḍika looked out for a quiet spot near Sāvatthī where the Buddha and the monks might dwell, and his eye fell on the park of Jetakumāra. He bought the park at great expense and erected therein the famous Jetavanārāma. As a result of this and of his numerous other benefactions in the cause of the Sāsana, Anāthapiṇḍika came to be recognised as the chief of alms-givers. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.25</c> 
               <br/>Anāthapiṇḍika’s personal name was Sudatta, but he was always called Anāthapiṇḍika (feeder of the destitute) because of his munificence; he was, however, very pleased when the Buddha addressed him by his own name. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.156</c>  He spent eighteen crores on the purchase of Jetavana and a like sum on the construction of the vihāra; another eighteen crores were spent in the festival of dedication. He fed one hundred monks in his house daily in addition to meals provided for guests, people of the village, invalids, etc.<br/>

               <br/>An Elder. Once when he was staying in a forest hut in the Mahāvana in Vesāli, near to where the Buddha was, certain wandering ascetics came to him and asked him whether or not a Tathāgata exists after death; dissatisfied with his answer they called him “fool” and went away. Thereupon Anurādha sought advice from the Buddha, who asked him “How, inasmuch as it cannot be said of a Tathāgata even in this very life that he really exists, can anything be said regarding him after death?” <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.116–119</c>

               </b>
               <br/>First cousin of the Buddha and one of his most eminent disciples. He was the son of the Sākyan Amitodana and brother of Mahānāma. When members of other Sākyan families had joined the Order of their distinguished kinsman, Mahānāma was grieved that none had gone forth from his own. He therefore suggested to his brother that one of them should leave household life. Anuruddha was at first reluctant to agree, for he had been reared most delicately and luxuriously, dwelling in a different house for each season, surrounded by dancers and mimes. But on hearing from Mahānāma of the endless round of household cares he agreed to go. He could not, however, get his mother’s consent until he persuaded his cousin Bhaddiya to go with him. Together they went with Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Devadatta and their barber Upāli, to the Blessed One at the Anupiya Mango Grove and were ordained. Before the rainy season was over Anuruddha acquired the divine eye. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.180–183</c>  He was later ranked foremost among those who had obtained this attainment. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.23</c> 
               <br/>He then received from Sāriputta, as topic of meditation, the eight thoughts of a great man. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.228ff.</c>  Another conversation he had with Sāriputta before becoming an arahant is reported. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.281–282</c>  He went into the Pācīnavaṃsadāya in the Ceti country to practise these. He mastered seven, but could not learn the eighth. The Buddha, being aware of this, visited him and taught it to him. Thereupon Anuruddha developed insight and realised arahantship in the highest grade. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.228ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.901</c> 
               <br/>When the Buddha, disgusted with the quarrels of the Kosambī monks, went away to seek more congenial surroundings, it was to Pācīnavaṃsadāya that he repaired, where were Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila. The Upakkilesa Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.iii.153f.</c>  on the sweets of concord and freedom from blemish, seems to have been preached specially to Anuruddha on that occasion, for we are told at the end that he was pleased to have heard it, no mention being made of the other two. And again in the Naḷakapāna Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.462ff.</c>  though a large number of distinguished monks are present, it is to Anuruddha that the Buddha directly addresses his questions, and it is Anuruddha who answers on behalf of them all. See also the Cūḷa—and the Mahā-Gosiṅga Suttas.<br/>Anuruddha was present when the Buddha died at Kusinārā, and knew the exact moment of his death; the verse he uttered on that occasion is thoughtful and shows philosophic calm, in contrast, for example, with that of Ānanda. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.156–157</c> 
               <br/>Anuruddha was foremost in consoling the monks and admonishing them as to their future course of action. It was Anuruddha again that the Mallas of Kusinārā consulted regarding the Buddha’s last obsequies. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.160f.</c> 
               <br/>In one of the verses ascribed to Anuruddha in the Theragāthā <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.904</c>  it is said that for twenty-five years he did not sleep at all, and that for the last thirty years of his life he slept only during the last watch of the night.<br/>The Anuruddha Saṃyutta <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.294</c>  gives an account of a series of questions asked by Moggallāna on the satipaṭṭhāna, their extent, etc. Anuruddha evidently laid great emphasis on the cultivation of the satipaṭṭhāna, for we find mention of them occurring over and over again in his discourses. He attributes all his powers to their development, and admonishes his hearers to practise them. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.299–306</c>  He himself considered the divine eye as the highest attainment. Thus in the Mahāgosiṅga Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.213</c>  he declares it to be more worthy than knowledge of the doctrine, meditation, forest-life, discourse on the abhidhamma or self-mastery.<br/>Once he lay grievously ill in the Andhavana in Sāvatthī, but the pain made no impression on his mind, because, he says, his mind was well grounded in the satipaṭṭhāna. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.302</c>  Apart from his teaching of the satipaṭṭhāna, he does not seem to have found fame as a teacher. He was of a retiring disposition and never interfered in any of the monks’ quarrels.<br/>Mention is often made of Anuruddha’s iddhi-powers. Thus, he was one of those who went to the Brahma-world to curb the pride of the Brahma who had thought that no ascetic could reach his world. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.145</c>  (The others being Moggallāna, Mahākassapa and Mahākappina.) The mother of the Yakkha Piyaṅkara, while wandering in search of food, heard him at night reciting some verses from the Dhammapada and stood spellbound listening. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.209</c> 
               <br/>His iddhi, however, does not seem to have enabled him to prevent his fellow-dweller Abhiñjika from talking too much, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.203–204</c>  nor his other fellow-dweller Bāhiya from attempting to create dissension in the Order. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.239</c>  Among the Vajjians he seems to have been held particularly in esteem, together with Nandiya and Kimbila. A yakkha named Dīgha tells the Buddha how the Vajjians are envied by the inhabitants of the deva and brahma worlds on account of the presence of these distinguished monks in their country. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.210</c>

               </b>
               <br/>A village in the Māgadha country, three gāvuta from Rājagaha. Between it and Rājagaha is the river Sappinī, which rises in the Gijjhakūṭa. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.109</c>  Once the Buddha went from Benares to Andhakavinda with 1,250 monks, and many people followed them carrying cartloads of provisions that they might feed them in turn. There were so many awaiting their turn that a certain brahmin (referred to as Andhakavindabrāhmana) had to wait two months for his to come round. At the end of two months, finding that his own affairs were going to ruin and that there was no likelihood of his turn coming soon, the brahmin went to the provision-room to see what deficiency he could possibly supply. Seeing there neither rice, milk, nor honey-lumps, he approached Ānanda, and having, through him, obtained the Buddha’s permission, the brahmin prepared a meal of milk-rice and honey-lumps for the Buddha and the monks. At the conclusion of the meal the Buddha spoke of the tenfold good qualities of milk-rice. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.220f.</c>  It was this praise uttered by the Buddha that made Visākhā ask him, as a favour, that she should be allowed to supply milk-rice to the monks throughout her life. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.293</c> 
               <br/>During the same visit of the Buddha, a newly converted minister of the district prepared meat dishes for the fraternity, but being disappointed that the monks, who had had a meal of solid milk-rice earlier, could not eat large quantities of his dishes, he was rather rude to them. Later he expressed remorse, and the Buddha assured him that heaven would be his inheritance <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.222f.</c>  (This was the occasion for the rule that monks who have been invited to a meal in one place should not accept milk-rice somewhere else earlier in the same day.) It was on the way back from Andhakavinda to Rājagaha that the Buddha met Belaṭṭha Kaccāna. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.224f.</c> 
               <br/>Once when the Buddha was staying at Andhakavinda the Brahmā Sahampati came and lighted the place with his effulgent beauty till late at night; then he sought the Buddha and sang before him verses of exhortation meant for the monks, urging them to lead the holy life. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.154</c>  Here, too, the Buddha mentioned to Ānanda the necessity of admonishing and encouraging new members of the Order with regard to five things: good conduct, control of the faculties of sense, abstinence from too much talking, love of solitude and the cultivation of right views. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.138–139</c>

               <br/>A grove to the south of Sāvatthī, one gāvuta away from the city. It was well guarded and monks and nuns used to resort there in search of solitude. The Bhikkhunī Saṃyutta contains stories of nuns who were tempted by Māra in the Andhavana, e.g., Āḷavikā, Soma, Kisāgotamī, Vijayā, Uppalavaṇṇā, Cālā, Upacālā, Sisūpacālā, Selā, Vajirā. <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp5</c> 
               <br/>Once when Anuruddha was staying there he became seriously sick. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.302</c>  It was here that the Buddha preached to Rāhula the discourse (Cūḷa-Rāhulovāda) which made him an arahant. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.105–107</c> 
               <br/>Among others who lived here from time to time are mentioned the Elders Khema, Soma, <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.358</c>  and Sāriputta, <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.9</c>  the last-mentioned experiencing a special kind of samādhi where he realised that bhavanirodha was nibbāna.<br/>The Vammika Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.143ff.</c>  was the result of questions put by an anāgami Brahma, his erstwhile colleague, to Kumāra-kassapa, while he was in Andhavana.<br/>The Pārājika <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.28ff.</c>  contains stories of monks who committed offences in the forest with shepherdesses and others, and also of some monks who ate the flesh of a cow which had been left behind, partly eaten, by cattle thieves. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.64</c>  It was here that Uppalavaṇṇā obtained the piece of cow’s flesh which she asked Udāyi to offer to the Buddha, giving Udāyi her inner robe as “wages” for the job. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.208–209</c> 
               <br/>The rule forbidding monks to enter a village clad only in their waist cloth and nether garment was made with reference to a monk whose robe had been stolen by thieves in Andhavana. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.298</c>

               <br/>On another occasion they discuss the “brahmin truth.” The Buddha visits them and tells them what he considers to be the brahmin truths (brāhmaṇasaccāni): that no creatures are to be harmed; all sense-delights are impermanent, painful and changing; all becomings are impermanent, etc.; a brahmin is one who has no part in or attachment to anything any more. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.176–177</c>

               </b> (2)  Abhayarājakumāra<br/>The son of King Bimbisāra and of Padumavatī, the belle of Ujjeni. When the boy was seven years old, his mother sent him to the king and he grew up with the boys of the court. He first came under the influence of the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, who taught him a dilemma to set the “Samaṇa Gotama.” In the Buddha’s reply, the prince recognised the defeat of the Nigaṇṭha and the supreme Enlightenment of the Exalted One, whose disciple he then became. Later, when the king died, Abhaya was disturbed in mind, and entered the Order. On the occasion of the preaching of the Tālacchiggalūpama Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.455</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.iii.169</c>  he became a Stream-enterer and afterwards attained arahantship. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.26</c>  The Abhayarājakumāra Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.392ff.</c>  contains the dilemma episode. It also mentions that at the time the prince had a little son of whom he was evidently very fond.<br/>In the Saṃyutta Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.126–128</c>  he is stated as having visited the Buddha at Gijjhakūṭa and discussed with him the views of Pūraṇa Kassapa. The Buddha teaches him about the seven bojjhangas.<br/>In the Vinaya, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.269</c>  Abhaya is mentioned as having discovered Jīvaka Komārabhacca lying on a dung-heap (cast there by the orders of his mother, the courtesan Sālavatī), and having brought him up.<br/>

On one occasion he comes with another Licchavi, Paṇḍita Kumāraka, to Ānanda in the Kūṭāgārasālā in Vesāli, and discusses with him certain views held by Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta. Ānanda teaches him the Buddha’s three Ways of purification. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.220–222</c>  On another occasion he visits the Buddha, again at Vesāli, with the Licchavi Sāḷha; the latter asks the Buddha’s views on purity of morals and self-mortification. The Buddha tells him of the Ariyan Way and explains its implications by various similes. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.202–204</c>  We are not told that either of them became converts on this occasion.<br/>

               </b> Ambaṭṭhamāṇava<br/>A brahmin youth of the Ambaṭṭha clan who lived with his teacher, Pokkharasādi, at Ukkaṭṭha. He was learned in the three Vedas and the correlated branches of knowledge, including the Lokāyata, as recorded in the Ambaṭṭha Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.87ff.</c>  Once, at the request of his teacher, he visited the Buddha in the Icchānadkala wood and seems to have opened his conversation by reviling the Sākiyans and calling them menials. It appears that Ambaṭṭha had once gone on some business of Pokkharasādi’s to Kapilavatthu, to the Mote Hall of the Sākyans, and had been insulted there. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.91</c> 
               <br/>Asked by the Buddha to what family he belonged, Ambaṭṭha replied that he came of the Kaṇhāyanā-gotta; thereupon the Buddha traced the family back to its ancestor, who had been the offspring of a slave girl of Okkāka, named Disā. The child had been able to talk as soon as he was born and, because of this devilish trait, had been called Kaṇha (devil), hence the family name. Kaṇha later became a mighty seer and married Maddarūpi, daughter of Okkāka. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.96–97</c> 
               <br/>Ambaṭṭha makes no remonstrance against this genealogy and, under pressure, accepts it as true. This gives the Buddha an opportunity of preaching on the futility of feeling vanity regarding one’s caste and on the worth of morality and conduct.<br/>At the end of the discourse the Buddha walked up and down outside his chamber so that Ambaṭṭha might see on his body the thirty-two signs of a great man. Ambaṭṭha goes back to Pokkharasadi and reports the whole interview. Pokkharasādi is greatly incensed, abuses Ambaṭṭha and kicks him. Later Pokkharasādi goes himself to the Buddha and invites him for a meal. At the end of the meal the Buddha instructs him in his Doctrine and is accepted as the Teacher both of Pokkharasādi himself and of his followers and dependants at Ukkaṭṭha. Pokkharasādi himself becomes a Sotāpanna.<br/>

               </b> Ambatitthā Ambatiṭṭha<br/>A village in the Cetiya country near Bhaddavatikā. When the Buddha was on tour near there he was repeatedly warned by the cowherds not to go to Ambatiṭṭha as in the Jaṭila’s hermitage in the village dwelt a mighty Nāga. While the Buddha was yet in Bhaddavatikā the Elder Sāgata went to the Jaṭila’s hermitage and took up his abode near the fireplace. The Nāga showed his resentment, but Sāgata was able to overcome him by means of his iddhi-powers. Later Sāgata visited the Buddha at Bhaddavatikā and went with him to Kosambī. The fame of the Elder’s victory over the Nāga had preceded him and the inhabitants of Kosambī were lavish in their hospitality to him. He drank wine in their houses and had to be carried to see the Buddha. The latter made this the occasion for declaring the drinking of intoxicants to be a pācittiya-offence. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.108–110</c>

This was during the Buddha’s last visit to Vesāli shortly before his death. It is said that when Ambapālī heard of the Buddha’s visit to Koṭigāma near Vesāli she and her retinue drove out of the city in magnificent chariots to meet him, and, after hearing a discourse, invited him and the monks to a meal the next day. The Buddha accepted this invitation and had, as a result, to refuse that of the Licchavis of Vesāli.<br/>While returning from her visit to the Buddha, Ambapālī was so elated at the idea of having the Buddha to a meal the next day, that she refused to make way for the Licchavi princes who were on their way to the Buddha. She refused to give up her invitation for anything in the world. Just before Ambapālī’s visit to him, the Buddha admonished the monks to be steadfast and mindful, lest they should lose their heads about her.<br/>It was after this meal that Ambapālī gave over her park, the Ambapālivana, to the Buddha and the Order.

Seeing their father disconsolate after his repeated attempts to foil Gotama’s quest for Enlightenment, they offered to tempt the Buddha with their wiles. This was in the fifth week after the Enlightenment. With Māra’s approval, they came to the Buddha in various forms and in various guises, as he sat at the foot of the Ajapala banyan tree, and danced and sang before him.

               </b> (1) <br/>A monk. He had been subjected by the Saṅgha to the ukkhepanīyakamma for refusal to renounce a sinful doctrine, namely, that the states of mind declared by the Buddha to be stumbling-blocks are not such at all for him who indulges in them.<br/>Ariṭṭha left the Order and would not come back until the ukkhepanīyakamma was revoked. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.25–28</c> 
               <br/>He was a vulture-trainer (gaddhabādhiputta).<br/>His case is cited as that of a pācittiya offence because he refused to give up a wrong doctrine even after the monks had three times requested him to do so. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.135</c> 
               <br/>In spite of the ukkhepanīyakamma the Chabbaggiyā (group of six) monks kept company with Ariṭṭha, thereby committing a pācittiya-offence. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.137</c>  We find the Buddha rebuking the nun Thullanandā for associating with Ariṭṭha after the ukkhepanīyakamma. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.218</c>

It is quite likely that ancient Avanti was divided into two parts, the northern part having its capital at Ujjenī and the southern part (also called Avanti Dakkhiṇāpatha) at Māhissati (Māhismatī).<br/>The King of Avanti was Pajjota, a man of violent temper <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.277</c>  and therefore known as Caṇḍa Pajjota. He wished to conquer the neighbouring kingdom of Kosambī, of which Udena was king, but his plans did not work out as he had anticipated.<br/>The kingdom of Assaka is invariably mentioned in connection with Avanti. Even in the Buddha’s life-time, Avanti became a centre of Buddhism. Among eminent monks and nuns who were either born or resided there, are to be found.<br/> Mahā Kaccāna Nanda Kumāraputta Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa Dhammapāla Abhayarājakumāra Isidatta and IsidāsīMahā Kaccāna seems to have spent a good deal of his time in Avanti, dwelling in the city of Kuraraghara in the Papāta Pabbata. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.9</c>

               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.46</c>  He experienced great difficulty in collecting ten monks, in order that Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa might receive the higher Ordination; in fact it was not until three years had elapsed that he succeeded. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.195</c>  Later, when Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa visited the Buddha at Sāvatthī, he conveyed to the Buddha Mahā Kaccāna’s request that special rules might be laid down for the convenience of the monks of Avanti Dakkhiṇāpatha and of other border countries. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.197–198</c>  The Buddha agreed, and among the rules so laid down were the following.<br/>The higher Ordination could be given with only four monks and a Vinayadhara. Monks are allowed the use of shoes with thick linings (because in Avanti the soil is black on the surface, rough and trampled by cattle).Monks are enjoined to bathe frequently.Sheepskins, goatskins, etc., could be used as coverlets. Robes could be accepted on behalf of a monk who has left the district, and the ten days’ rule with regard to such a gift will not begin until the robes have actually reached the monk’s hands. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.195–196</c>  By the time of the Vesāli Council, however, Avanti had become one of the important centres of the orthodox school, for we find Yasa Kākandakaputta sending messengers to Avanti to call representatives to the Council, and we are told that eighty-eight arahants obeyed the summons. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.298–299</c> 
               <br/>Even in the Buddha’s day there were rumours of the King of Avanti making preparations to attack Māgadha, but we are not told that he ever did so. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.iii.7</c>  Subsequently, however, before the time of Candagupta, Avanti became incorporated with Māgadha.<br/>Avanti is now identified with the country north of the Vindhaya Mountains and north-east of Bombay, roughly corresponding to modern Mālwa, Nimār and adjoining parts of the Central Provinces.<br/>

Once, while in Tāvatiṃsā heaven, he saw the whole city decked with splendour and the gods engaged in great rejoicing. On inquiry he learnt that Siddhattha Gotama, destined to become the Buddha, had been born. Immediately he went to Suddhodana’s home and asked to see the babe. From the auspicious marks on its body he knew that it would become the Enlightened One and was greatly overjoyed, but realising that he himself would, by then, be born in an Arūpa world and would not therefore be able to hear the Buddha preach, he wept and was sad. Having reassured the king regarding the babe’s future, Asita sought his sister’s son, Nalaka, and ordained him that he might be ready to benefit by the Buddha’s teaching when the time came. <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.p.131–136</c>

They conceived the view that the brahmins are the highest class of men and that they alone are the legitimate sons of Brahma. Hearing of this, Asita Devala appeared before their hermitage in orange attire, with stout sandals and staff, and shouted for them. The brahmins cursed him with the intention of shrivelling him into a cinder, but the more they cursed the more comely and handsome grew Asita. Feeling that their austerities were evidently fruitless, they questioned Asita who urged them to discard their delusion. Having learnt his identity, they saluted him and wished to be instructed; Asita examined and cross-questioned them about their pretensions regarding their lineage and they could find no answer. They thereupon followed his advice and renounced their claims to superiority.<br/>

               </b>
               <br/>A headman (gāmani). He came to the Buddha in the Pārileyyaka Mango Grove in Nāḷandā and asked him various questions, recorded in the Saṃyutta Nikāya. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.312ff.</c>  One of these related to the custom among the Western (Pacchābhūmakā) brahmins of lifting a man up when dead and carrying him out, calling him by name to speed him heavenward. Surely the Buddha who is an arahant, etc., could make the whole world go to heaven thus if he chose. To this the Buddha answers no, and explains, by various similes, that only a man’s kamma can determine where he will be reborn. On another occasion, the Buddha tells him, in answer to a question, that the Buddha teaches the Dhamma in full only to certain disciples and not to others; just as a farmer sowing seed selects, first the best field, then the moderate, and lastly, the field with the worst soil.<br/>Asibandhakaputta is said to be a disciple of the Jains, and tells the Buddha that, according to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.317</c>  as a man habitually lives so goes he forth to his destiny. The Buddha points out the absurdity of this view and tells him that all Tathāgatas lay down definite rules for the guidance of their followers, so that they may attain development.<br/>It is recorded <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.322ff.</c>  that once, when Nāḷandā was stricken with famine, Asibandhaka visited Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, who asks him to go and defeat the Buddha in debate. Asibandhaka is at first reluctant, but his teacher propounds to him a dilemma to put to the Buddha, and he agrees to go.<br/>Is it true that the Buddha extols compassion to clansmen? Why, then, does the Buddha ask for alms in a place stricken with famine? The Buddha’s answer is that there are eight ways of injuring clansmen, and that begging for alms is not one of them. And Asibandhakaputta, pleased with the answer, declares himself to be a follower of the Buddha.<br/>

               <br/>In Pali Literature the Asuras are classed among the inferior deities together with the supaṇṇas, gandhabbas, yakkhas, garuḍas and nāgas. Rebirth as an Asura is considered as one of the four unhappy rebirths or evil states (apāya), the others being hell, animal, and ghost realms. <c c="#3b6bd3">It.93</c> 
               <br/>The fight between the Devas and the Asuras is mentioned even in the oldest books of the Tipitaka and is described in identical words in several passages. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.285</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.222</c>

               <br/>A chief or king of the Asuras is often referred to as Asurinda, several Asuras being credited with the role of leader, most commonly, however, Vepacitti <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.222</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.201ff.</c>  and Rāhu. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.17</c>

               <br/>There were evidently several classes of Asuras, and two are mentioned in the Pitakas, the Kālakañjakas and the Dānaveghasas. The Dānaveghasas carried bows in their hands. The Kālakañjakas were of fearsome shape, <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.259</c>  and were considered the lowest among the Asuras. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.7</c> 
               <br/>A story is told by the Buddha <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.446</c>  of a man who once saw a whole army with its four divisions enter a lotus stalk and the man thought he was mad. But the Buddha says that it was an Asura army in flight. Here the Asuras would seem to be fairies or nature spirits.<br/>

               <br/>The followers of Assaji and Punabbasu. They lived in Kīṭāgiri, between Sāvatthī and Ālavi, and were guilty of various evil practices. They used to grow flowers, make wreaths and garlands, and send them to girls and women of respectable families and also to slave girls, to lie with such women, and disregard the precepts regarding the eating of food at the wrong time, using perfumes, visiting shows, singing and playing games of various sorts. Their abandoned ways of life won popularity for them, and virtuous monks, who did not belong to their group, were not welcomed by the people of the neighbourhood.<br/>The Buddha heard of their nefarious doings from a monk who had been sojourning in the district, and having convened a meeting of the Saṅgha, sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna, together with a number of other monks, (for the recalcitrant were passionate and violent), to carry out the Pabbājanīyakamma (Act of Banishment) against them. The deputation of the Saṅgha went to Kīṭāgiri and made an order that the Assaji-Punabbasukā should no longer dwell there, but the latter, instead of obeying the injunction, abused the monks, accusing them of partiality, and not only departed from Kīṭāgiri, but also left the Order. When the matter was reported to the Buddha he had the Pabbājanīyakamma revoked. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.9–13</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.14</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.15</c> 
               <br/>The Assaji-Punabbasukas seem to have had a special dislike for Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Once the Buddha, on his way somewhere from Sāvatthī, accompanied by Sāriputta, Moggallāna and five hundred others, sent word to the Assaji-Punabbasukas to prepare sleeping places for them. They sent answer that the Buddha was very welcome, but not Sāriputta and Moggallāna, because “they were men of sinful desires and influenced by such desires.”. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.171</c> 
               <br/>But elsewhere <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.473ff.</c>  even the Buddha is represented as having been lightly regarded by them. When it was reported to them that the Buddha lived on only one meal a day and found that it made him well and healthy, their reply was that they themselves ate in the evening and the early morning and at noon and outside prescribed hours, and that they found this quite agreeable and saw no reason for changing their mode of life. It is true, however, that even on this occasion when the Buddha sent for them, they came dutifully and listened patiently to his admonition on the necessity of implicit obedience to a teacher in whom they had faith, and we are told that they were “even gladdened in their hearts” after hearing the Buddha. There is, however, no evidence that they reformed after hearing him.<br/>

               </b> (1) <br/>The fifth of the Pañcavaggiyā monks. When the Buddha preached the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, he was the last in whom dawned the eye of Truth, and the Buddha had to discourse to him and to Mahānāma while their three colleagues went for alms. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.13</c>  He became an arahant, together with the others, at the preaching of the Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.14</c> 
               <br/>He was responsible for the conversion of Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Sāriputta, in the course of his wanderings, saw Assaji begging for alms in Rājagaha, and being pleased with his demeanour, followed him till he had finished his round. Finding a suitable opportunity, Sāriputta asked Assaji about his teacher and the doctrines he followed. Assaji was at first reluctant to preach to him, because, as he said, he was but young in the Order. But Sāriputta urged him to say what he knew, and the stanza which Assaji uttered then, has, ever since, been famous, as representing the keynote of the Buddha’s teaching:<br/>“ye dhammā hetuppabhavā tesam hetum Tathāgato āha tesañ ca yo nirodho, evaṃvādī Mahāsamano.”<br/>Sāriputta immediately understood and hurried to give the glad tidings to Moggallāna that he had succeeded in his quest. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.39ff.</c> 
               <br/>One day when Assaji was going about in Vesāli for alms, the Nigaṇṭha Saccaka, who was wandering about in search of disputants to conquer, saw him, and questioned him regarding the Buddha’s teaching because he was a well-known disciple Assaji gave him a summary of the doctrine contained in the Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta. Feeling sure that he could refute these views attributed to the Buddha, Saccaka went with a large concourse of Licchavis to the Buddha and questioned him. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Cūḷa-Saccaka Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.227ff.</c> 
               <br/>The Saṃyutta Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.124ff.</c>  records a visit paid by the Buddha to Assaji as he lay grievously sick in Kassapārāma near Rājagaha. He tells the Buddha that he cannot enter into jhāna because of his difficulty in breathing and that he cannot win balance of mind. The Buddha encourages him and asks him to dwell on thoughts of impermanence and non-self.<br/>

               </b>
               <br/>A young brahmin, sixteen years old, of Sāvatthī, very learned in the Vedas and allied subjects. Five hundred brahmins staying in the city asked him to hold a discussion with the Buddha and refute his views. He agreed only after repeated requests, because, he said, Gotama was a thinker with views of his own and, therefore, difficult to defeat in controversy.<br/>He visits the Buddha and asks what he has to say concerning the claims of the brahmins to be the only superior class, the legitimate sons of Brahma.<br/>The Buddha points out to him that such pretensions are baseless, and that virtue, which alone leads to purity, can be cultivated by any of the four classes. Assalāyana sits silent and upset at the end of the discourse, but when the Buddha relates to him a story of the past where Asita Devala had defeated brahmins who held these same views, Assalāyana feels relieved and expresses his admiration of the Buddha’s exposition. He declares himself a follower of the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.147ff.</c>

                  <c c="#a00149">Ājīvakā</c>
               </b> Ājīvikā<br/>A class of naked ascetics, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.291</c>  followers of Makkhali Gosāla, regarded, from the Buddhist point of view, as the worst of sophists. Numerous references to the Ājīvakas are to be found in the Pitakas, only a few of them being at all complimentary. Thus in the Mahā Saccaka Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.238</c>  they are spoken of as going about naked, flouting life’s decencies and licking their hands after meals.<br/>It is stated in the Tevijja Vacchagotta Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.483</c>  that far from any Ājīvaka having put an end to sorrow, the Buddha could recall only one Ājīvaka during ninety-nine kappas who had even gone to heaven, and that one too had preached a doctrine of kamma and the after-consequences of actions. Elsewhere <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.524</c>  they are spoken of as children of a childless mother. They extol themselves and disparage others and yet they have produced only three shining lights: Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, Makkhali Gosāla. A fourth leader, Paṇḍuputta, of wagon-building stock, is mentioned in the Anaṅgaṇa Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.31</c>  ; there is also the well-known Upaka.<br/>There is no doubt that the Ājīvaka were highly esteemed and had large followings of disciples.<c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.68</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.398</c>  They had eminent followers such as high court officials. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.166</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.71</c> 
               <br/>The doctrines held by the Ājīvaka are mentioned in several places, but the best known account is in the Sāmaññaphala Sutta where they are attributed to Makkhali Gosāla by name <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.53–54</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.516f.</c>  He maintained that there is no cause or reason for either depravity or purity among beings. There is no such thing as intrinsic strength, or energy or human might or endeavour. All creatures, all beings, everything that has life, all are devoid of power, strength and energy; all are under the compulsion of the individual nature to which they are linked by destiny; it is solely by virtue of their birth in the six environments (chalabhijātiyo) that they experience their pleasure or pain. The universe is divided into various classes of beings, of occupations and methods of production. There are eighty-four hundred thousand periods during which both fools and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, shall at last make an end of pain. The pleasures and pain, measured out as it were with a measure, cannot be altered in the course of transmigration; there can be neither increase nor decrease thereof, neither excess nor deficiency.<br/>The fundamental point in their teaching seems, therefore, to have been “saṃsāra-suddhi,” purification through transmigration, which probably meant that all beings, all lives, all existent things, all living substances attain and must attain, perfection in course of time.<br/>

               <br/>A town that lay between Kusinārā and Sāvatthī. Once the Buddha, with a large company of bhikkhus, visited the town. At that time there dwelt in it a monk who had been ordained late in life and had formerly been a barber. He had two sons, handsome, elegant and well versed in the barber’s art. When the monk heard of the Buddha’s coming, he sent his sons from house to house to collect salt and oil and rice and meal. The young men, using all their powers of persuasion, collected a large quantity of each of these things, and when the Buddha arrived in Ātumā and went to stay in the Bhūsāgāra, they made ready rice-gruel and offered it to him. The Buddha, however, would not accept it as the monk, who had had the food collected, had been guilty of an unlawful act in that one monk had begged for others.<br/>It was on this occasion that it was declared to be a dukkaṭa offence for a monk, who had formerly been a barber, to carry about with him a barber’s equipment. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.249–250</c> 
               <br/>In the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.131–132</c>  the Buddha tells Pukkusa of another occasion on which he was staying in the Bhūsāgāra in Ātumā. There was a thunderstorm and two peasants and four oxen were struck by lightning. A large number of people having gathered at the place, one of them asked the Buddha if he were aware of the accident. But the Buddha had been in a state of concentration and had neither seen nor heard anything of it. Such was the state of calm of his mind.<br/>

Ārāmadaṇḍa stood up with clasped hands and, turning in the direction of Sāvatthī, he uttered his adoration of the Buddha. Thenceforward he became a disciple of Mahā Kaccāna. A.i.65–67.<br/>

               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.212ff.</c>  the Buddha describes his visit to Āḷāra. Gotama quickly mastered his doctrine and was able to repeat it by heart; but feeling sure that Āḷāra not only knew the doctrine but had realised it, he approached him and questioned him about it. Āḷāra then proclaimed the Ākiñcaññāyatana, and Gotama, putting forth energy and concentration greater than Āḷāra’s, made himself master of that state. Āḷāra recognised his pupil’s eminence and treated him as an equal, but Gotama, not having succeeded in his quest, took leave of Āḷāra to go elsewhere. When, after having practised austerities for six years, the Buddha attained Enlightenment and granted Sahampati’s request to preach the doctrine, it was of Āḷāra he thought first as being the fittest to hear the teaching. But Āḷāra had died seven days earlier. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.7</c> 
               <br/>The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.130</c>  mentions a Mallian, Pukkusa, who says he had been Āḷāra’s disciple, but who, when he hears the Buddha’s sermon, confesses faith in the Buddha. Pukkusa describes Āḷāra to the Buddha as one who practised great concentration. Once Āḷāra was sitting in the open air and neither saw nor heard five hundred passing carts though he was awake and conscious.<br/>

In the same context, Vāsava, ruler of the gods, identified with Sakka, is addressed by Gopaka as “Indra.”. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.274</c>  He is mentioned with Brahmā and Pajāpati. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.140</c>

The Buddha questioned them as to their practises and preached to them the above-mentioned Sutta, which he afterwards repeated to Mahānāma. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.91ff.</c> 
               <br/>Once when the Buddha was dwelling at Kāḷasilā, he sang the praises of Rājagaha, giving Ānanda a chance, if he so desired, of asking him to live on for a kappa; but Ānanda did not take his opportunity. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.116</c>

Men, observing this, said that the mountain swallowed up the sages and so it came by its name of Isigili (“Gullet of the Sages“).<br/>

               <br/>According to the Saṃyutta Nikāya, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.283–288</c>  Isidatta was once staying with a number of senior monks at Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Ambātaka grove. Citta-gahapati invited the monks to a meal. On this occasion Citta asked a question regarding the Buddha’s teaching on the diversity of the elements. The chief Elder, being unable to answer, remained silent. Isidatta, though the most junior of the whole company, obtained the chief Elder’s permission, and answered the question to the satisfaction of Citta. Citta likewise asked questions regarding various views, such as the infinity of the world, etc. At the end of the discourse, Citta discovered, by accident, that the Elder who had preached to him was none other than his unseen friend, Isidatta. Delighted with the discovery, he invited Isidatta to spend his time at a Macchikāsaṇḍa, promising to provide him with all requisites. But that same day Isidatta left Macchikāsaṇḍa and never returned.<br/>

They heard that the Buddha was having a robe made before starting on his rounds and they waited for an opportunity to talk to him. When the opportunity came they followed the Buddha and told him how glad they always were when he was near them and how sad when he was away on tour. The Buddha preaches to them the glory of the homeless life and urges them to put forth energy. He speaks very appreciatively of their loyalty to him and to his religion and congratulates them on the possession of virtuous qualities, such as sharing all their goods with holy men, a rare quality. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.348–352</c> 
               <br/>In the Dhammacetiya Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.123f.</c>  Pasenadi tells the Buddha how impressed he is by the reverence Isidatta and Purāṇa show for the Buddha and his teachings. “They are my carriage-builders,” says the king, “and they depend on me for their livelihood and all their honours, yet these men do not serve me as whole-heartedly as they do the Lord.”<br/>Once the king spent the night in a cramped little house. Isidatta and Purāṇa, who were with him, having spent the best part of the night in discussing the Doctrine, lay down to rest with their heads in the direction in which they thought the Buddha to be, and their feet towards the king!<br/>Isidatta was the uncle of the woman-disciple Migasālā, whose father was Purāṇa. Purāṇa is described as a brahmacāri, but not Isidatta, yet, after death, they were both born in Tusita. Migasālā asks Ānanda how it was that people of different characters could have the same rebirth. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.348f.</c>

She was married again with the same result, and a third time to a friar. Isidāsī’s father persuaded him to give up the pilgrim’s life; he dwelt with his wife only for a fortnight and refused to stay with her any more. Isidāsī then met the therī Jinadattā, whom she entertained to a meal at her house. Under Jinadattā, Isidāsī joined the Order and became an arahant.<br/>The Therīgāthā, <c c="#3b6bd3">Thig.400–447</c>  which contains forty-seven verses ascribed to her, describes not only her present life, but also her past lives. She had been a worker in gold in Erakaccha and had committed adultery in that life. As a result she was born in hell for a long time, and, in subsequent births became an ape, a goat, an ox, a hermaphrodite slave and a carter’s daughter. In this last birth she was sold to a merchant in payment of her father’s debts. When she was sixteen, the merchant’s son, Giridāsa, fell in love with her and married her. He had already one wife, and the new one caused dissension between her and her husband. Therefore it was that in this life she was hated by her husbands.<br/>

The Sutta goes on to say that Ugga died soon after and was born among the Manomayadevā.

Having made preparations for a great sacrifice, in which numerous animals were to be slaughtered, he visited the Buddha at Jetavana to consult him as to the efficacy of the sacrifice. Three times he told the Buddha that he had heard that the laying down of the fire and the setting up of the sacrificial post bore great fruit. Three times the Buddha agreed that it was so, and Uggatasarīra was about to conclude that the Buddha approved of his sacrifice, when Ānanda intervened and suggested that the Buddha should be asked to explain his meaning and to give his advice as to the efficacy of the sacrifice. The Buddha thereupon declared that there were three fires to be cast off: greed, hatred, and delusion; and three fires that should be honoured: āhuneyyaggi, gahapataggi and dakkhiṇeyyaggi. The āhuneyyaggi was represented by the parents; the gahapata, by wife, children, servants and retainers; the dakkhiṇeyya, by holy men and recluses.<br/>At the end of the discourse, Uggatasarīra became a convert to the Buddha’s faith and set free the animals destined for the sacrifice. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.41–46</c>

               <br/>A mythical region. A detailed description of it is given in the Āṭānāṭiya Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.199ff.</c>  The men who live there own no property nor have they wives of their own; they do not have to work for their living. The corn ripens by itself and sweet-scented rice is found boiling on hot oven-stoves. The inhabitants go about riding on cows, on men and women, on maids and youths. Their king rides on an elephant, on a horse, on celestial cars and in state palanquins. Their cities are built in the air, and among those mentioned are Āṭānāṭā, Kusināṭā, Nātapuriyā, Parakusināṭā, Kapīvanta, Janogha, Navanavatiya, Ambara-Ambaravatiya and Āḷakamandā, the last being the chief city.<br/>The king of Uttarakuru is Kuvera, also called Vessavaṇa.<br/>The country is to the north of Jambudīpa. It is one of the four Mahādīpā—the others being Aparagoyāna, Pubbavideha and Jambudīpa—each being surrounded by five hundred minor islands. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.227</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.59</c>  These four make up a Cakkavāla, with Mount Meru in their midst, a flat-world system. A cakkavattī’s rule extends over all these four continents. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.173</c> 
               <br/>The trees in Uttarakuru bear perpetual fruit and foliage, and it also possesses a Kapparukkha which lasts for a whole kappa. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.264</c> 
               <br/>The Buddha is said to have travelled with his psychic powers to Uttarakuru for alms. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.27–28</c>

               <br/>A Yakkhinī, mother of Punabbasu and Uttarā. Once as she passed Jetavana at sunset looking for food, with her daughter on her hip and holding her son by his finger, she saw the assembly, intently listening to the Buddha’s sermon. She, too, hoping to get some benefit, listened quietly and with great earnestness, hushing her children to quietness. The Buddha preached in such a manner that both she and her son could understand, and at the end of the sermon they both became Sotāpannā. She immediately got rid of her sad Yakkha-state and obtained heavenly bliss, and took up her residence in a tree near the Buddha’s Fragrant Chamber. Little Uttarā was too young to realise the Truth. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.210</c>

               <br/>The northern division of Jambudīpa. Its boundaries are nowhere explicitly stated in Pāḷi literature. Perhaps Uttarāpatha was originally the name of a great trade-route, the northern high road which extended from Sāvatthī to Takkasilā in Gandhāra, and that it lent its name—as did the Dakkhiṇāpatha—to the region through which it passed. If this be so, the name would include practically the whole of Northern India, from Aṅga in the east to Gandhāra in the north-west, and from the Himālaya in the north to the Vindhyā in the south.<br/>This region was famous from very early times for its horses and horse-dealers, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.6</c>  and horses were brought down for sāle from there to such cities as Benares.<br/>

When the Buddha preached the Nāgopama Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.344f.</c>  on the occasion when Seta, King Pasenadi’s elephant, was publicly admired, Udāyī was stirred to enthusiasm by thoughts of the Buddha and uttered sixteen verses, extolling the virtues of the Buddha, comparing him to a great and wondrous elephant. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.689–704</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.346–347</c> 
               <br/>Once when Udāyī was staying at Kāmandā, in Todeyya’s mango-grove, he converted a pupil of a brahmin of the Verahaccāni clan and, as a result, was invited by Verahaccāni herself to her house. It was only on his third visit to Verahaccāni that Udāyī preached to her and she thereupon became a follower of the Faith. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.121–124</c> 
               <br/>The Saṃyutta Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.166f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.426f.</c>  also records a conversation between Udāyī and Ānanda, when Udāyī asks if it is possible to describe the consciousness, too, as being without the self. On another occasion Udāyī has a discussion with Pañcakaṅga on feeling. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.396ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.223–224</c>  Ānanda overhears their conversation and reports it to the Buddha, who says that Udāyī’s explanation is true, though not accepted by Pañcakaṅga.<br/>Elsewhere. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.86ff.</c>  Udāyī is mentioned as asking the Buddha to instruct him on the awakening factors, and once, at Desaka in the Sumbha country, he tells the Buddha how he cultivated the awakening factors and thereby attained to final emancipation. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.89</c> 
               <br/>He is rebuked by the Buddha for his sarcastic remark to Ānanda, that Ānanda had failed to benefit by his close association with the Master. The Buddha assures him that Ānanda will, in that very life, become an arahant. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.228</c> 
               <br/>Udāyī was evidently a clever and attractive preacher, for he is mentioned as having addressed large crowds, a task demanding great powers, as the Buddha himself says when this news of Udāyī is reported to him. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.184</c>

Uddaka taught him the doctrine which had been realised and proclaimed by Rāma, which was the attainment of the state of “neither-perception-nor-non-perception”. When Gotama had mastered this, Uddaka made him more than his own equal by setting him over the whole company of his disciples as their teacher. But Gotama, finding this doctrine unsatisfactory, abandoned it. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.165ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.240ff.</c> 
               <br/>The Buddha evidently had a high regard for Uddaka-Rāmaputta, for after the Enlightenment, when looking for someone to whom the Dhamma might be preached, and who was capable of realising its import at once, his thoughts turned to Uddaka, but Uddaka was already dead. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.7</c>

The Buddha agrees and says that Upaka himself has been guilty of this offence. Upaka protests against being caught in a big noose of words, like a fish caught as soon as he pops up his head. The Buddha explains that it is necessary for him to teach with endless variations of words and similes. Upaka is pleased with the Buddha’s talk and reports the conversation to Ajātasattu. The king shows his anger at the man’s presumption in having remonstrated with the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.181f.</c>

                  <c c="#a00149">Upananda</c>
               </b> (1) <br/>A monk, belonging to the Sākyan clan, who was known for his greed in procuring requisites. Several incidents connected with him are mentioned in the Vinaya. Once he promised to spend the rainy season with Pasenadi Kosala, but on his way there he saw two lodgings where robes were plentiful and so kept Vassa in those lodgings instead. Pasenadi was greatly annoyed and when, in due course, the matter reached the ears of the Buddha, Upananda was rebuked and a set of rules was passed regarding promises made about the rainy season. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.153</c>  On another occasion Upananda spent the rainy season at Sāvatthī, but when the time came for the monks to gather together and divide the robes that had been given to them, he went from village to village, taking his share of the robes from everywhere. The Buddha sent for him and rebuked him in the presence of the Order, but the rebuke had evidently no effect, for we find him again spending the Vassa alone in two residences, with the idea of obtaining many robes. The Buddha, however, ordered that only one portion should be given to him. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.300</c>  His greediness was not confined to robes. Once he was invited to a meal by an official, a follower of the Ājīvakas. He went late, and finding no room left for him, made a junior monk get up and give him his seat. There was a great uproar, but Upananda had his way. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.165</c>  Elsewhere he is accused of having appropriated two lodgings for himself at the same time, one at Sāvatthī and the other somewhere in the country. He was evidently unpopular among the monks, because on this occasion we find him spoken of as “a maker of strife, quarrelsome, a maker of disputes, given to idle talk, a raiser of legal questions.”. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.168</c>  Upananda was fond of money, for we find in the Vinaya <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.297</c>  a statement to the effect that “on the occasion of the matter of Upananda the Sākyan, the Buddha distinctly laid down a precept by which gold and silver were forbidden.” Upananda had been given his meals regularly by a certain<br/>family. Once a dish of meat was prepared for him, but a little boy in the house started to cry for the meat, and it was given to him. Upananda insisted that a kahāpaṇa should be paid to him in lieu of the meat. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.236f.</c>  Upananda was once asked to preach to those that came to Jetavana. Among the visitors was a banker, and when the banker expressed the desire to give something to Upananda to show his appreciation of the sermon, Upananda wished to have the robe that the man wore. The banker was embarrassed, and promised to go home at once and fetch him another robe, even better than the one he had on. But Upananda was adamant, till, in despair, the man gave him his robe and went away. Again, when Upananda heard that a certain man wished to offer him a robe, he went to the man and told him what kind of robe he wanted, and said he would accept no other. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.215</c>  A story is also told of a Paribbājaka exchanging his own garment for one belonging to Upananda, which was of rich colour. Two other Paribbājakas told him that he had lost in the bargain, so he wished to cry off the deal, but Upananda positively refused. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.240f.</c>  He did not, however, always come off best in a bargain. Once he gave a robe to a colleague, on condition that the latter should join him in his tours. The condition was agreed to, but later, when the recipient monk heard that the Buddha was going on tour, he preferred to join the Buddha’s company. The robe was not returned to Upananda, who had to be reported to the Buddha for the violent language he used to the defaulter. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.254f.</c>  Upananda is mentioned as quarrelling with the Chabbaggiyā monks <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.30</c>  and, at another time, as going his alms-rounds with a colleague with whom he quarrelled when the rounds were over, refusing to give him any of the food obtained. The unfortunate monk had to starve because it was then too late to go out begging again. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.92f.</c>  We are not told whether Upananda deliberately set out to have a quarrel in order that he might keep all the food himself!<br/>Nor were all Upananda’s misdemeanours confined to greed for possessions. We are told that once a complaint was made to the Buddha that Upananda had gone to the house of an acquaintance and had sat down in the bedroom of the woman of the house, talking to her. The husband ordered food to be brought to Upananda, and when that was done, asked him to leave. But the woman wished him to stay and he refused to go away. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.94</c> 
               <br/>On two other occasions he is mentioned as visiting the houses of his acquaintances and being found by the husbands, seated alone with their wives. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.95–97</c> 
               <br/>With most laymen, however, be was evidently popular. Mention is made of a meal where the donor kept all the other monks waiting for quite a long while, till Upananda should arrive, after his visits to various households. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.98</c>  And, again, of food being sent to the monastery with express instructions that the other monks should eat only after Upananda had done so. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.99</c> 
               <br/>Upananda had under him two novices, Kaṇḍaka and Mahaka, who seem to have resembled their teacher in being undesirables. They were found guilty of having sex together, and the Buddha laid down a rule forbidding a monk from having two novices as students. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.79</c>  This rule seems to have been rescinded later. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.83</c>

               </b>
               <br/>A monk who was occasionally the attendant of the Buddha, and who features in a number of discourses. Once when the Buddha was attacked by cramp, Upavāna, with the help of his lay-friend Devahita, obtained hot water and suitable medicines, with which the ailment was healed; the Buddha, thereupon, expressed his gratitude. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.174f.</c> 
               <br/>When the Buddha lay on his death-bed at Kusināra, Upavāna was by his side fanning him; the Buddha, seeing that he obstructed the vision of the devas who had come to pay their last homage to the Teacher, asked Upavāna to move away. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.138f.</c> 
               <br/>Two occasions are mentioned on which Upavāna consulted the Buddha on matters of doctrine, once regarding the arising of suffering <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.41–2</c>  and once on the immediate and practical use of the Dhamma. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.41</c>  There is also recorded a visit of Upavāna to Sāriputta when they were both staying in the Ghositārāma at Kosambī. Sāriputta asks him about the bojjhangas as being conducive to a happy life and Upavāna explains. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.76</c>  On another occasion Upavāna is the enquirer, and he asks Sāriputta about the “end-maker”; Sāriputta explains that the “end-maker” is the one who knows and sees things as they really are. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.163</c> 
               <br/>When an unpleasant interview took place between Sāriputta and Lāludāyī and no one was found to support Sāriputta, the matter is reported to the Buddha, who declares that Ānanda should have taken Sāriputta’s side. Soon afterwards Ānanda seeks Upavāna and tells him that he was too timid to interfere, and if the Buddha referred to the matter again, would Upavāna undertake to answer? In the evening the Buddha engages Upavāna in conversation and asks him to explain the five qualities which make a monk esteemed and loved by his colleagues. At the end of the discourse the Buddha applauds Upavāna. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.195f.</c>

                  <c c="#a00149">Upasena</c>
               </b> Vaṅgantaputta<br/>When his ordination was but one year old, he ordained another bhikkhu, to increase the number of holy ones, and went with him to wait upon the Buddha. The Buddha roundly rebuked him for this hasty procedure. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.59</c>  Later the Buddha declared Upasena to be the best of those who were altogether charming (samantapāsādikānaṃ). <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.24</c>  He visited the Buddha when the Buddha had enjoined on himself a period of solitude for a fortnight; the monks had agreed that anyone who went to see the Buddha would be guilty of a pācittiya offence, but the Buddha, desiring to talk to him, asked one of Upasena’s followers if he liked rag-robes. “No, Sir, but I wear them out of regard for my teacher,” was the reply. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.230ff.</c> 
               <br/>In the Theragāthā are found several verses ascribed to Upasena as having been spoken by him in answer to a question by his student, regarding what was to be done during the dissensions of the Kosambī monks <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.577–586</c>  The Udāna states <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.p.45f.</c>  that once when he was taking his siesta he reviewed the happiness he enjoyed and the glories of the life he led under the guidance of the Buddha. The Buddha, noticing this, proclaimed his approval.<br/>One day, while Upasena was sitting after his meal in the shadow of the Sappasondika-pabbhāra, fanned by the gentle breeze, mending his outer robe, two young snakes were sporting in the tendrils overhanging the cave. One fell on his shoulder and bit him, and the venom spread rapidly throughout his body; he called to Sāriputta and other monks who were near, and requested that he might be taken outside on a couch, there to die. This was done, and his body “was scattered there and then like a handful of chaff.”. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.40f.</c>

               <b>
                  <c c="#a00149">Upāli </c>
               </b> (1) <br/>One of the most eminent of the Buddha’s immediate disciples. He belonged to a barber’s family in Kapilavatthu and entered the service of the Sākiyan princes. When Anuruddha and his cousins left the world and sought ordination from the Buddha at Anupiya Grove, Upāli accompanied them.<br/>At the request of the Sākiyan youths, the Buddha ordained Upāli before them all, so that their pride might be humbled. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.182</c> 
               <br/>Upāli’s upajjhāya was Kappitaka. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.308</c> 
               <br/>In the assembly of the Saṅgha, the Buddha declared him to be the most proficient of those who were learned in the Vinaya <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.24</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.142</c>  In the First Council, Upāli took a leading part, deciding all the questions relative to the Vinaya, in the same way as Ānanda decided questions regarding the Dhamma. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.286f.</c> 
               <br/>In accordance with this tradition, ascribing to Upāli especial authority regarding the rules of the Order, various instances are given of Upāli questioning the Buddha about the Vinaya regulations. Thus we find him consulting the Buddha as to the legality or otherwise of a complete congregation performing, in the absence of an accused monk, an act at which his presence is required. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.325f.</c>  Again, he wishes to know if, in a matter which has caused altercations and schisms among members of the Order, the Saṅgha declares re-establishment of concord without thorough investigation, could such a declaration be lawful?. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.358f.</c>  When a monk intends to take upon himself the conduct of any matter that has to be decided, under what conditions should he do so? What qualities should a monk possess in himself before he takes upon himself to warn others?. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.248f.</c>  In what case can there be an interruption of the probationary period of a monk who has been placed on probation?. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.33f.</c> 
               <br/>A whole list of questions asked by Upāli and answers given by the Buddha on matters pertaining to the Vinaya rules is found in the chapter called Upāli-Pañcaka in the Parivārā <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.v.180–206</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.70ff.</c> 
               <br/>It is said <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.142</c>  that even in the Buddha’s lifetime monks considered it a great privilege to learn the Vinaya under Upāli. The monks seem to have regarded Upāli as their particular friend, to whom they could go in their difficulties. Thus, when certain monks had been deprived by thieves of their clothes, it is Upāli’s protection that they seek. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.212</c> 
               <br/>The canon contains but few records of any discourses connected with Upāli, apart from his questions on the Vinaya. In the Aṅguttara Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.143f.</c>  he is mentioned as asking the Buddha for a brief sermon, the Buddha telling him that if there were anything that did not conduce to revulsion and detachment, Upāli could be sure that such things did not form part of the Buddha’s teaching. There is a record of another sermon <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.201ff.</c>  which the Buddha is stated to have preached when Upāli expressed the desire to retire into the solitude of the forest. The Buddha tells him that forest-life is not for the man who has not mastered his mind or attained to tranquillity.<br/>Three verses are ascribed to Upāli in the Theragāthā <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.249–251</c>  where he admonishes the brethren to seek noble friends of unfaltering character, to learn the monks’ code of discipline and to dwell in solitude.<br/>

                  <c c="#a00149">Upāli</c>

His parents, wishing him to live a life of ease, did not have him instructed in any of the usual means of livelihood, lest he should be inconvenienced while learning them. After much consideration, they decided to have him ordained. He joined the Order with sixteen other companions equally young, and it is said that they rose at dawn and started shouting for food. This was the reason for the rule that no one under twenty years of age should receive the upasampadā ordination. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.77f.</c> 
               <br/>

                  <c c="#a00149">Upāli</c>
               </b> (3)  Upāligahapati<br/>He was present when Dīgha-Tapassī reported to Nāṭaputta an account of his visit to the Buddha in the Pāvārika Mango-grove. Upāli undertook to go himself to the Buddha and refute his views, in spite of the protestations of Dīgha-Tapassī. At the end of his discussion with the Buddha, which is recorded in the Upāli Sutta, Upāli is converted and invites the Buddha to a meal. Although the Buddha enjoins upon Upāli that his benefactions to the Nigaṇṭhas should not cease because of his conversion, Upāli gives instructions that no Nigaṇṭha be admitted to his presence, but that if they need food it shall be given to them. Hearing a rumour of his conversion, first Tapassī, and later Nāṭaputta himself, go to Upāli’s house, where they learn the truth. When Nāṭaputta is finally convinced that Upāli has become a follower of the Buddha, hot blood gushes from his mouth. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.371ff.</c>

               <br/>A township of the Mallas in the Malla country.

               <br/>Once when the Buddha was staying at Uruvelakappa, he informed Ānanda that he wished to spend the day alone in the Mahāvana, and he went there and sat down at the foot of a tree. Meanwhile the householder Tapassu arrived and told Ānanda that be could not understand how young men in the prime of life found any attraction in renouncing the world. Ānanda took Tapassu to the Buddha, who set his doubts at rest. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.438ff.</c>

               <br/>Mention is made of several temptations of the Buddha while he dwelt at Uruvelā, apart from the supreme contest with Māra, under the Bodhi-tree. Once Māra came to him in the darkness of the night in the guise of a terrifying elephant, trying to frighten him. On another dark night when the rain was falling drop by drop, Māra came to the Buddha and assumed various wondrous shapes, beautiful and ugly. Another time Māra tried to fill the Buddha’s mind with doubt as to whether he had really broken away from all fetters and won complete Enlightenment. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.103ff.</c>  Seven years after the Buddha’s Renunciation, Māra made one more attempt to make the Buddha discontented with his lonely lot and it was then, when Māra had gone away discomfited, that Māra’s three daughters, Taṇhā, Ratī and Ragā, made a final effort to draw the Buddha away from his purpose. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.124f.</c> 
               <br/>It was at Uruvelā, too, that the Buddha had misgivings in his own mind as to the usefulness of preaching the Doctrine which he had realised, to a world blinded by passions and prejudices. The Brahmā Sahampati thereupon entreated the Buddha not to give way to such diffidence.<c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.136ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.4f.</c>  It is recorded that either on this very occasion or quite soon after, the thought arose in the Buddha’s mind that the sole method of winning Nibbāna was to cultivate the four satipaṭṭhānas and that Sahampati visited the Blessed One and confirmed his view.<c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.167</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.185</c>  A different version occurs elsewhere, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.232</c>  where the thought which arose in the Buddha’s mind referred to the five controlling faculties, and Brahmā tells the Buddha that in the time of Kassapa he had been a monk named Sahaka and that then he had practised these five faculties.<br/>

               </b> Kassapa<br/>One of three brothers, the Tebhātika-Jatilas, living at Uruvelā. After initial resistance, all became the Buddha’s followers. He lived on the banks of the Nerañjara with five hundred disciples. Further down the river lived his brothers Nadī-Kassapa with three hundred disciples and Gayā-Kassapa with two hundred.<br/>The Buddha visited Uruvelā-Kassapa and took lodging for the night where the sacred fire was kept, in spite of Kassapa’s warning that the spot was inhabited by a fierce Nāga. The Buddha, by his magical powers, overcame, first this Nāga and then another, both of whom vomited fire and smoke. Kassapa being pleased with this exhibition of iddhi-power, undertook to provide the Buddha with his daily food. Meanwhile the Buddha stayed in a grove near by, waiting for the time when Kassapa should be ready for conversion. Here he was visited by the Four Regent Gods, Sakka, Brahma and others. The Buddha spent the whole rainy season there, performing, in all, three thousand five hundred miracles of various kinds, reading the thoughts of Kassapa, splitting firewood for the ascetics’ sacrifices, heating stoves for them to use after bathing in the cold weather, etc. Still Kassapa pesagested in the thought, “The great ascetic is of great magic power, but he is not an arahant like me.” Finally the Buddha decided to startle him by declaring that he was not an arahant, neither did the way he followed lead to arahantship. Thereupon Kassapa owned defeat and reverently asked for ordination. The Buddha asked him to consult with his pupils, and they cut off their hair and threw it with their sacrificial utensils into the river and were all ordained. Nadī-Kassapa and Gayā-Kassapa came to inquire what had happened, and they, too, were ordained with their pupils. At Gayāsīsa the Buddha preached to them the Fire Sermon, and they all attained arahantship.<br/>From Gayāsīsa the Buddha went to Rājagaha with the Kassapas and their pupils, and in the presence of Bimbisāra and the assembled populace Uruvelā-Kassapa declared his allegiance to the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.24ff.</c> 
               <br/>Later, in the assembly of monks, Uruvelā-Kassapa was declared to be the chief of those who had large followings. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.25</c>  Six verses attributed to him are found in the Theragāthā, <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.375–380</c>  wherein he reviews his achievement and relates how he was won over by the Buddha.<br/>

The Buddha replies that birth’s invidious bar has been laid down by the brahmins, without consulting anybody else; all four castes alike can live the good life, which is the true service, and follow the Dhamma, which is the true wealth. At the end of the discourse Esukārī declares himself to be a follower of the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.177ff.</c>

               </b>
               <br/>A king, ancestor of the Sākyas and the Kolians.<br/>In the Ambaṭṭha Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.92</c>  it is stated that Okkāka, being fond of his queen and wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished from the kingdom the elder princes by another wife. These princes were named Okkāmukha, Karakaṇḍa, Hatthinika, and Sīnipura. They lived on the slopes of the Himalaya and, consorting with their sisters and their descendants, formed the Sākyan race.<br/>Okkāka had a slave-girl called Disā, who gave birth to a black baby named, accordingly, Kaṇha. He was the ancestor of the Kaṇhāyanas, of which race the Ambaṭṭha-clan was an offshoot. Later, Kaṇha became a mighty sage and, by his magic power, won in marriage Maddarūpi, another daughter of Okkāka. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.93</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.96</c> 
               <br/>According to the Brāhmaṇa-Dhammika Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.p.52ff.</c>  it was during the time of Okkāka that the brahmins started their practice of slaughtering animals for sacrifice. Till then there had been only three diseases in the world—desire, hunger and old age; but from this time onwards the enraged devas afflicted humans with various kinds of suffering.<br/>

When the Buddha arrived at Nādikā on his last journey, Ānanda asked him what had happened to Kakudha, who was already dead.

Having died, he was reborn among the mind-born devas with a body so large that it was as extensive as “two of three common rice-fields in a Māgadha village, and yet so constituted that he was in the way neither of himself nor of others.” Becoming aware of Devadatta’s plans for obtaining possession of the leadership of the Saṅgha, Kakudha reported the news to Moggallāna, who passed it on to the Buddha. The Buddha asked Moggallāna to keep the matter secret. Moggallāna informed the Buddha that he knew from experience that Kakudha’s predictions proved true. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.185f.</c>

Pessa saluted the Buddha and sat down, while Kandaraka, after his salutation, remained standing. Surveying the assembly of monks gathered round the Buddha and observing their great silence, Kandaraka expressed his admiration of the Buddha’s training. The Buddha explained that all Buddhas school their disciples in the four satipaṭṭhānas. Pessa stated that it was far more difficult to train men than animals. The Buddha agreed and enumerated the four kinds of people in the world: those who torment themselves, torment others, torment both themselves and others, and, lastly, those who torment neither, dwelling beyond appetites, in bliss and holiness. Pessa stated that he respected only the fourth class, and having given his reasons went away. The Buddha expressed his regret that Pessa could not wait to hear the differences between these four kinds of people; and at the request of the monks the Buddha proceeded to describe them. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.339ff.</c>

                  <c c="#a00149">Kapilavatthu</c>
               </b>
               <br/>A city near the Himalaya, capital of the Sākiyan republic. The administration and judicial business of the city and all other matters of importance were discussed and decided in the Santhāgārasālā. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.91</c>  The Buddha and his company lived in the Nigrodhārāma or the Mahāvana. When the Buddha returned a few years after his enlightenment, he met many of his family, and several of them ordained, including Nanda and Rāhula. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.82</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.180</c>  
               <br/>The Buddha certainly paid other visits besides these to Kapilavatthu. Various Sākyans went to see him both at the Nigrodhārāma and at the Mahāvana, among them being Mahānāma, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.369f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.284f.</c>

               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.91</c>  and perhaps Sārakāni. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.372</c> 
               <br/>During one visit the Buddha was entrusted with the consecration of a new mote-hall, built by the Sākyans; he preached far into the night in the new building, and, when weary, asked Moggallāna to carry on while he slept. On this occasion was preached the Sekha Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.353ff.</c> 
               <br/>The books record a visit paid by the Brahmā Sahampati to the Buddha in the Mahāvana at Kapilavatthu. The Buddha, worried by the noisy behavior of some monks who had recently been admitted into the Order, was wondering how he could impress on them the nature of their calling. Sahampati visited him and, being thus encouraged, the Buddha returned to Nigrodhārāma and there performed a miracle before the monks; seeing them impressed, he talked to them on the holy life. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.91f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.25</c> 
               <br/>A curious incident is related in connection with a visit paid by the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, when he went there after his rounds among the Kosalans. Mahānāma was asked to find a place of lodging for the night; he searched all through the town without success, and at length the Buddha was compelled to spend the night in the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu, the Kālāman. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.276f.</c>  On another occasion we hear of the Buddha convalescing at Kapilavatthu after an illness. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.219</c> 
               <br/>Not all the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu believed in their kinsman’s great powers. We find, for instance, Daṇḍapāṇi meeting the Buddha in the Mahāvana and, leaning on his staff, questioning him as to his tenets and his gospel. We are told that in answer to the Buddha’s explanations, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, waggled his tongue, and went away, still leaning on his staff, his brow puckered into three wrinkles. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.108f.</c> 
               <br/>Others were more convinced and patronised the Order—e.g., Kāla-Khemaka and Ghaṭāya, who built cells for monks in the Nigrodhārāma, as a result of noticing which the Buddha preached the Mahāsuññata Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.iii.109</c> 
               <br/>Mahānāma was the Buddha’s most frequent visitor; to him was preached the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.91f.</c> 
               <br/>The Dakkhiṇā-vibhaṅga Sutta was preached as the result of a visit to the Buddha by Mahā-Pajāpatī-Gotamī. Apart from those already mentioned, another Sākyan lady lived in Kapilavatthu, Kāḷigodhā by name, and she was the only kinsman, with the exception of the Buddha’s father and wife, to be specially visited by the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.396</c> 
               <br/>The inhabitants of Kapilavatthu are called Kāpilavatthavā. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.182</c> 
               <br/>From Kapilavatthu lay a direct road to Vesālī, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.253</c>  and through Kapilavatthu passed the road taken by Bāvarī’s disciples from Alaka to Sāvatthī. <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.p.194</c> 
               <br/>It was not mentioned by Ānanda among the great cities, in one of which, in his opinion, the Buddha could more fittingly have died than in Kusinārā. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.146</c>  After the Buddha’s death, a portion of the relics was claimed by the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu, and a shrine to hold them was erected in the city. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.167</c>

The yakkha immediately fell down and was swallowed up in the fires of hell.

               <br/>A brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan, living at Ekanālā, in Dakkhiṇāgiri, and so called on account of his profession of agriculture. On the day of his festive sowing, the Buddha visited him alone, and stood near the place where food was being distributed to a very large number of people engaged in the festival. The brahmin, seeing the Buddha begging for alms, suggests that the Buddha should work for his living—plough and sow just as he does. The Buddha answers that he, too, is a farmer, and explains his meaning to the bewildered brahmin, who, greatly pleased, offers him a large bowl filled with milk-rice. The Buddha refuses the gift on the plea that Buddhas never accept wages for their sermons. At the Buddha’s own suggestion the food is cast into the river because no one is capable of digesting food once offered to a Tathāgata. When the rice touches the water it crackles and smokes and the brahmin, greatly marvelling, falls at the Buddha’s feet and professes himself henceforth the Buddha’s follower. <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.12ff.</c>

               </b> (1) <br/>A monk living in Vāsabhagāma in the Kāsi kingdom. He was in the habit of showing extreme hospitality to the monks who came there from other parts. Once some monks who visited him enjoyed his hospitality and stayed on. After some time, feeling that they had outstayed their welcome, Kassapagotta grew tired of looking after them and was blamed by them for his neglect. He therefore went to Campā, where he laid his case before the Buddha, who declared that no blame attached to him. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.312ff.</c>

               </b> (2) <br/>A monk living in Pankadhā in the Kosala country. He heard the Buddha preach a sermon, but was not satisfied with it and kept on thinking— “This recluse is much too scrupulous”. Later, he was filled with remorse and, having sought the Buddha at Rājagaha, begged forgiveness for his thoughtlessness. The Buddha praised him for having seen his transgression, and for his confession thereof and determination to practise self-restraint. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.236f.</c>

               </b> (3) <br/>A monk, perhaps to be identified with one of the others of the same name. He was once staying in a forest tract in Kosala and, seeing a trapper pursuing deer, intervened and protested against the man’s earning his living by such cruel means. The trapper was too preoccupied with his quarry to pay much attention to what was said. A deva of the forest drew near the monk and instructed him not to waste his time in preaching to a man who heard but did not understand what was being said. Kassapa was agitated and, according to the Commentary, gave himself up to much striving and became an arahant. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.198f.</c>

When Pajjota discovered that Jīvaka had fled, after administering to him some medicine containing ghee, he sent Kāka to overtake Jīvaka and bring him back, giving Kāka strict injunctions not to eat anything offered by Jīvaka.<br/>Kāka came upon the physician at Kosambī having his breakfast. Jīvaka invited him to eat, but he refused. In the end, however, he consented to eat half a myrobalan, which he thought would be harmless, but into which Jīvaka had introduced some drug hidden in his finger nail. Kāka purged violently and was very alarmed. Jīvaka told him that all he desired was for him to be slightly delayed and left him, after having handed over to him the elephant Bhaddavatikā, which he had used in his flight. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.277f.</c>

The Buddha, knowing that Kāpathika had questions to ask of him, gave him an opportunity for so doing, and there followed a discussion on various points, detailed in the Caṅkī Sutta. At the end of the discussion the youth declared himself a disciple of the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.168ff.</c>  In the Sutta the Buddha addresses Kāpathika as Bhāradvāja, perhaps because he belonged to that gotta.<br/>

               </b> Kāsika Kāsigāma Kāsinigama<br/>One of the sixteen Great Nations, <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.213</c>  its capital being Bārāṇasī.<br/>At the time of the Buddha, it had been absorbed into the kingdom of Kosala, and Pasenadi was king of both countries.<c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.288</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.111</c>  The Vinaya, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.28l</c>  however, mentions a Kāsika-rājā who sent a robe to Jīvaka. Even at this time, however, the memory of Kāsi as an independent kingdom seems to have been still fresh in men’s minds. It is very frequently mentioned as such in the Jātakas and elsewhere. Kāsi was once ruled by the Bhāratas, one of whom, Dhataraṭṭha, was its king in the time of Reṇu. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.235f.</c>  There seem to have been frequent wars between the countries of Kāsi and Kosala, victory belonging now to one, now to the other. In one such war, Dīghāti the Kosala king, was defeated by the king of Kāsi, but Dīghīti’s son Dīghāvu won back the kingdom. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.334</c> 
               <br/>The traditional name of the king of Kāsi from time immemorial was evidently Brahmadatta, and references to kings of that name abound in the Jātakas. Among other kings of Kāsi mentioned is Kikī . <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.49</c> 
               <br/>Kāsi was evidently a great centre of trade and a most populous and prosperous country. Frequent mention is made of caravans leaving Kāsi to travel for trade. One highway went through Kāsi to Rājagaha <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.212</c>  and another to Sāvatthī. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.10</c>  Kāsi was famed for her silks, and Kāsi-robes were most highly esteemed as gifts. Mention is also made of the perfumes of Kāsi. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.391</c> 
               <br/>Besides those already referred to, other names of places mentioned in literature as belonging to Kāsi, are Vāsabhagāma, Macchikāsaṇḍa, Kīṭāgiri and Dhammapālagāma. Kāsi and Kosala are frequently mentioned together. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.59</c> . Kāsigāma or Kāsinigama was probably the actual name of the village in Kāsi which was given by Mahākosala to his daughter when she married Bimbisāra. The village produced a revenue of one hundred thousand, and was given to the queen for her bath and perfume money. After Bimbisāra’s death, Pasenadi withdrew the gift from Ajātasattu, which act was the cause of a war between the two. Later, when Pasenadi’s daughter Vajirā was married to Ajātasattu, the village was given back as part of her dowry. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.82ff.</c>

When the Buddha was asked to spend the rainy season there he refused, as he had already accepted the invitation of Ghaṭīkāra of Vehaliṅga. Kikī was at first hurt by the refusal, but when the Buddha described Ghaṭīkāra’s virtues, the king was pleased and sent five hundred cartloads of provisions to Ghaṭīkāra who, however, curtly refused the gift. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.7</c>

The conversation took place in the Veḷuvana in Kimbilā.<br/>Elsewhere <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.322f.</c>  the Buddha is reported as questioning Kimbila at the same spot on the question of breathing. Kimbila remains silent though the question is put three times. Ānanda intervenes and suggests that the Buddha should himself furnish the answer so that the monks may learn it and profit thereby.<br/>

But the monks, having heard of the man’s poverty, had a full meal earlier, so that when the man served them with the food he had prepared they could eat but very little. The man was greatly offended and the Buddha, hearing of it, made an order to the monks prohibiting such conduct. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.75f.</c>

               </b>
               <br/>The capital of the Mallas and the scene of the Buddha’s death. At that time it was a small city, “a branch-township with wattle-and-daub houses in the midst of the jungle,” and Ānanda was, at first, disappointed that the Buddha should have chosen it for his Parinibbāna. But the Buddha pointed out to him that in ancient times it had been Kusāvatī, the royal city of Mahā-Sudassana. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.146ff.</c>  It was twelve leagues in length and twelve in breadth, prosperous and full of people, like Āḷakamandā. It was then at the head of eighty-four Towns. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.144</c> . <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.170f.</c> 
               <br/>Between Kusinārā and Pāvā lay the stream of Kakuttha on the banks of which was the Ambavana; beyond that was the Hiraññavatī river.<br/>After the Buddha’s death his body was carried into the city by the northern gate and out of the city by the eastern gate; to the east of the city was Makuṭabandhana, the shrine of the Mallas, and there the body was cremated. For seven days those assembled at the ceremony held a festival in honour of the relics. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.160f.</c> 
               <br/>As the scene of his death, Kusinārā became one of the four holy places declared by the Buddha to be fit places of pilgrimage for the pious, the other three being Kapilavatthu, Buddhagayā and Isipatana. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.140</c>  Mention is made of other visits paid to Kusinārā by the Buddha, prior to that when his death took place. Thus, once he went there from Āpaṇa and having spent some time at Kusinārā, proceeded to Ātumā. The Mallas of Kusinārā were always great admirers of the Buddha, even though not all of them were his followers, and on the occasion of this visit they decided that any inhabitant of Kusinārā who failed to go and meet the Buddha and escort him to the city, would be fined five hundred. It was on this occasion that Rojā the Mallan was converted and gave to the Buddha and the monks a supply of green vegetables and pastries. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.247f.</c>  During some of these visits the Buddha stayed in a wood called Baliharana, and there he preached two of the Kusinārā Suttas <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.274f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.79f.</c>  and the “Kinti” Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.238f.</c>  A third Kusinārā Sutta he preached while staying at Upavattana. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.79</c>

               <br/>The Licchavis waited on the Buddha and ministered to him during his stay in the Kūṭāgārasālā, and it is said that they were of various hues: some blue, others yellow, etc. And Piṅgiyānī, seeing the Buddha shining in their midst, surpassing them all, once uttered the Buddha’s praises in verse, winning, as reward from the Licchavis, five hundred upper garments, all of which, be, in turn, presented to the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.239f.</c>  On one occasion, when the Buddha was preaching to the monks regarding the six spheres of sense contact, Māra arranged an earthquake to break the monks’ concentration, but failed to achieve his object. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.112</c>  It was here that the Buddha finally agreed to grant the request of the five hundred Sākyan women, led by Pajāpatī Gotamī, that they might be ordained as nuns. They had followed the Buddha hither from Kapilavatthu <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.274f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.253f.;</c>  The Buddha gave Pajāpatī Gotamī, at her special request, a summary of his doctrine. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.280</c>  It was also at the Kūṭāgārasālā that the Buddha uttered his prophecy as to the ultimate downfall of-the Licchavis. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.267f.</c> 
               <br/>It was customary for the Buddha, when staying at the Kūṭāgārasālā, to spend the noonday siesta in the woods outside the Mahāvana, at the foot of a tree; visitors coming at that time would, if their desire to see him was insistent, <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.151</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.75</c>  seek him there or be conducted to him. Sometimes he would express his desire to see no one during such a retreat, except the monk who brought him his food.<br/>On one occasion the retreat lasted a fortnight, and on his return he found that a large number of monks had committed suicide as a result of a sermon he had preached to them before his retreat on the un-loveliness of the body. He then caused the monks to be assembled, and asked them to concentrate on breathing. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.320f.</c>  Sometimes the Buddha would walk from the Kūṭāgārasālā to places of interest in the neighbourhood—e.g., the Sārandada-cetiya <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.167</c>  and the Cāpāla-cetiya.<c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.258</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.308f.</c>  It was from the Cāpāla-cetiya, during one of these walks that he gazed for the last time on Vesāli. He then returned to the Kūṭāgārasālā, where he announced that his death would take place within three months. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.119f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.258ff.</c> 
               <br/>There was a sick ward attached to the monastery, where the Buddha would often visit the patients and talk with them. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.210f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.142</c>

               <br/>A brahmanical matted hair ascetic. He lived in Āpaṇa, and when the Buddha once stayed there with one thousand three hundred and fifty monks, Keṇiya visited the Buddha, bringing various kinds of drinks, which he gave to him and to the monks. The following day he invited the whole company to a meal and showed great hospitality. It was as a result of the drinks offered by Keṇiya that the Buddha laid down a rule as to which drinks were permissible for monks and which were not. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.245f.</c> 
               <br/>According to the Sutta Nipāta <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.p.104</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.146f.</c>  it was owing to the elaborate preparations made by Keṇiya for the meal to the Buddha and the Saṅgha that the brahmin Sela, friend and counsellor of Keṇiya, came to discover the Buddha’s presence in Āpaṇa. The result was the conversion and ordination of Sela and his three hundred pupils.<br/>

This was the route taken by Ānanda when he went with five hundred others to inflict the higher punishment on Channa, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.290</c>  though there seems to have been a land route passing through Anupiya and Kosambī to Rājagaha. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.184f.</c>  In the Sutta Nipāta <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.1010–1013</c>  the whole route is given from Mahissati to Rājagaha, passing through Kosambī, the halting-places mentioned being Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā, Bhoganagara and Vesāli.<br/>Near Kosambī, by the river, was Udena’s park, the Udakavana, where Ānanda and Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja preached to the women of Udena’s palace on two different occasions. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.290f.</c>  The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Siṃsapāvana in Kosambī. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.437</c> 
               <br/>Already in the Buddha’s time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambī—the Kukkuṭārāma, the Ghositārāma, the Pāvārika-ambavana, and the Badarikārāma. The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books.<br/>A great division once arose among the monks in Kosambī. Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be dismissed. The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong. The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged. The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks’ behaviour, the quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī and, journeying through Bālakaloṇakāragāma and the Pācīnavaṃsadāya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthī, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.337–357</c>  The story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in the Udāna <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.iv.5</c>  and in the Saṃyutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.94</c>  but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics.<br/>During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.298</c> 
               <br/>It was at Kosambī that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.307</c> 
               <br/>Kosambī is mentioned in the Saṃyutta Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.179</c>  as being on the Ganges, but here as elsewhere this simply means on a great river, in this case the Yamuna.<br/>

               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.252</c>  In the Buddha’s time it was a powerful kingdom ruled over by Pasenadi, who was succeeded by his son Viḍūḍabha. By this time Kāsī was under the subjection of Kosala. With the capture of Kāsi the power of Kosala increased rapidly, until a struggle between this country and Māgadha became inevitable. Quite soon after Bimbisāra’s death there were many fierce fights between Ajātasattu, his successor, and Pasenadi, these fights bringing varying fortunes to the combatants. The Sutta Nipāta <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.405</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.276</c>  speaks of the Buddha’s birthplace as belonging to the Kosalans. Elsewhere. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.124</c>  Pasenadi is reported as saying, that both the Buddha and he were Kosalans.<br/>At the time of the Buddha Sāvatthī was the capital of Kosala. Next in importance was Sāketa. There was also Ayojjha, on the banks of the Sarayu.<br/>Other Kosala rivers mentioned in the books are the Aciravatī <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.235</c>  and the Sundarikā, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.167</c>

               <br/>The Buddha spent the greater part of his time in Kosala, either in Sāvatthī or in touring in the various parts of the country, and many of the Vinaya rules were formulated in Kosala.<br/>Kosala is often mentioned in combination with Kāsi in the compound Kāsi-Kosala; Pasenadi was king of Kāsi-Kosala. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.59</c>

Once, when he lay very ill at the Badarikārāmā, near Kosambī, some monks, staying at the Ghositārāma, sent one of their number, Dāsaka, with a message to Khemaka, inquiring whether he managed to bear his pains. Dāsaka returned with the reply that he did not; he was sent again to ask if Khemaka had seen the self in the five khandhas; when Dāsaka returned with the answer that he had not, be was sent a third time to ask whether Khemaka was an arahant. “No,” came the answer, and Dāsaka had to visit him a fourth time with the inquiry, What did Khemaka mean by self? In exasperation Khemaka came himself to Ghositārāma and explained how, even when the Noble Disciple has put away the five lower fetters, there still clings to him a subtle remnant of the “I” conceit. It is said that as a result of the sermon Khemaka himself and sixty others became arahants. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.126ff.</c>

Such, for example, are: the Paṭibhānakūṭa, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.448</c>  the Sītavana, where the Buddha went to visit Soṇa, <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.374</c>  the river Sappinī, on the banks of which lived various Paribbājakas, including Sarabha, <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.185</c>

Does this perhaps mean that the people of Nādikā were more interested in this problem than the people of other places? It was by way of finding a permanent solution to these questions that the Buddha preached to Ānanda at Giñjakāvasatha the “Mirror of Truth” on his last visit to Nādikā, as described in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.91ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.357</c> 
               <br/>The “Brick Hall” was, however, not designed for the Buddha and his monks alone, for we find mention of members of other sects staying there, e.g., the Paribbājaka Sabhiya Kaccāna. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.401</c>  The building was probably a resting place for all travellers.<br/>

There he made various vain attempts to win arahantship, achieving only temporary emancipation of mind, from which he then fell away. Six times this happened and then he decided to commit suicide by cutting his throat. Māra saw this and reported it to the Buddha, but when the Buddha arrived it was too late and Godhika lay “supine on his couch with his shoulders twisted around.” The Buddha, however, declared that Godhika had attained Nibbāna.<br/>

               </b> Benares<br/>The capital of Kāsi-janapada. It was one of the four places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists - the others being Kapilavatthu, Buddhagayā and Kusināra - because it was at, the Migadāya in Isipatana near Bārānasī that the Buddha preached his first sermon to the Pañcavaggiyā <c c="#3b6bd3">D.ii.141</c> . This was the spot at which all Buddhas set in motion the Wheel of the Law (Dhamma-cakka). It is the custom of Buddhas to travel by air from the Bodhi-tree to the scene of their first sermon, a distance of eighteen leagues <c c="#3b6bd3">MA.i.388</c> ; <c c="#3b6bd3">Bu.A.242</c> , etc., but the present Buddha did all the journey on foot in order to be able to meet on the way the Ajīvaka Upaka.<br/>Benares was an important centre of trade and industry. There was direct trade between there and Sāvatthi (DhA.iii.429), the road passing through Bhaddiya <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.189</c> , and between there and Takkasilā <c c="#3b6bd3">DhA.i.123</c> .

From Benares the road continued to Vesāli <c c="#3b6bd3">Sp.i.201</c> . On the road from Benares to Rājagaha was Andhakavinda <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.220</c> . There seems to have been friendly intercourse between the chieftains of Benares and the kings of Magadha, as shown by the fact that Bimbisāra sent his own physician, Jīvaka, to attend to the son of the Treasurer of Benares <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.275</c> . The distance from Kosambī to Benares was thirty leagues by river <c c="#3b6bd3">MA.ii.929</c> .<br/>The extent of the city of Benares, including its suburbs, at the time when it was the capital of an independent kingdom, is often stated E.g., <c c="#3b6bd3">J.iv.377</c> ; <c c="#3b6bd3">J.vi.160</c> ; <c c="#3b6bd3">MA.ii.608</c>  to have been twelve leagues. The names of several kings are mentioned in the Jātakas, among them being those of Anga, Uggasena, Udaya, Kikī, Dhanañjaya, Mahāsīlava, Vissasena, and Samyama. (The SNA. on the Khaggavisāna Sutta contains the names of several kings of Benares who renounced the world and became Pacceka Buddhas).<br/>The name which occurs most frequently, however, is that of Brahmadatta, which seems to have been the dynastic name of the Benares kings. In the Mahāgovinda Sutta, the foundation of Bārānasī is attributed to Mahāgovinda, its first king being Dhatarattha, contemporary of Renu <c c="#3b6bd3">D.ii.235</c> . The Ceylon Chronicles <c c="#3b6bd3">MT. 127,129,130</c>  mention the names of others who reigned in Benares - e.g., Duppasaha and sixty of his descendants; Asoka, son of Samankara, and eighty four thousand of his descendants; also sixteen kings, ancestors of Okkāka. The city itself had been known by different names at different periods; thus, in the time of the Udaya Jātaka it was called Surundhana; in that of the Sutasoma, Sudassana; in that of the Sonananda, Brahmavaddhana; in that of the Khandahāla, Pupphavatī; in that of the Yuvañjaya, Rammanagara <c c="#3b6bd3">J.iv.119f</c> ; and in that of the Sankha, Molinī <c c="#3b6bd3">J.iv.15</c> . It was also called Kāsinagara and Kāsipura E.g., <c c="#3b6bd3">J.v.54</c> ; <c c="#3b6bd3">J.vi.165</c> ; <c c="#3b6bd3">DhA.i.87</c> , being the capital of Kāsi. The Bhojājāniya Jātaka <c c="#3b6bd3">J.i.178</c>  says that 'all the kings around coveted the kingdom of Benares.' In the Brahāchatta Jātaka <c c="#3b6bd3">J.iii.116</c> , the king of Benares is mentioned as having captured the whole of Kosala. At the time of the Buddha, however, Benares had lost its great political importance. Kosala was already the paramount power in India, and several successful invasions of Kāsi by the Kosalans under their kings Vanka, Dabbasena and Kamsa, are referred to. The final conquest would seem to be ascribed to Kamsa because the epithet Bārānasīggha (conqueror of Benares) is an established addition to his name <c c="#3b6bd3">J.ii.403</c> .<br/>Later, when Ajātasattu succeeded in establishing his sway over Kos.<br/>

               </b>
               <br/>In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a potter of Vehaliṅga, looking after his blind parents. He was a very pious and devoted follower of the Buddha, ministering to him better than anyone else, and the Buddha accepted his invitation in preference to that of the king of Benares. It is said that when the Buddha was in need of anything he would go to Ghaṭīkāra’s house and take it, whether he were at home or not, so great was his confidence in Ghaṭīkāra’s piety. Once, when Ghaṭīkāra was absent, the people, at the Buddha’s suggestion, took away the thatch from his house to roof the hut of Tathāgata. For three months Ghaṭīkāra’s house remained open to the sky, but no rain fell on it, so great was his faith.<br/>The Bodhisatta, who at the time of Ghaṭīkāra was a young brahmin named Jotipāla, was the friend of Ghaṭīkāra but had no faith in the Buddha, and Ghaṭīkāra, having failed to persuade him to visit the Buddha, in the end took him by force. Jotipāla was converted and joined the Order, but Ghaṭīkāra, as the only support of his parents, could not renounce the world. Kikī, king of Benares, having heard of his virtues from Kassapa Buddha, sent him five hundred cartloads of the choicest rice, etc., but Ghaṭīkāra returned the gifts, saying that he had plenty for himself. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.46ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.35f.</c> 
               <br/>According to the Saṃyutta Nikāya, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.35f.</c>  Ghaṭīkāra visited the Buddha some time after the Enlightenment and the Buddha reminded him of their former friendship. Ghaṭīkāra, on that occasion, speaks of several others who had been his friends in Vehaliṅga—Upaka, Phalaganda, Pukkusāti, Bhaddiya, Khaṇḍadeva, Bāhuraggi and Piṅgiya. They had listened to the Buddha’s teaching and, after death, were born in the Avihā-world, where he himself was. In this context the Buddha addresses him as Bhaggava.<br/>

At the conclusion of the talk he declared himself converted and wished to offer to Udena the daily allowance of five hundred kahāpanas which he regularly received from the king of Aṅga. Udena suggested that the money might be utilised to build an assembly-hall for the Order at Pāṭaliputta.

               <br/>The Wheel Treasure that is one of the seven treasures of a Wheel Turning Monarch (cakkavatti). The Cakkaratana is the Cakkavatti’s chief symbol of office; on its appearance before him, he sprinkles it with water and asks it to travel to the various quarters of the world, winning them for him. This the Cakkaratana does, carrying with it through the air the Cakkavatti with his fourfold army. Wherever the Cakkaratana halts, all the chiefs of that quarter acclaim the Cakkavatti as their overlord and declare their allegiance to him. Having thus traversed the four quarters of the earth, it returns to the Cakkavatti’s capital, and remains fixed as an ornament on the open terrace in front of his inner apartments. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.173f.</c>

               </b>
               <br/>A World ruler. The world itself means “Turner of the Wheel,” the Wheel (Cakka) being the well known Indian symbol of empire. More than one thousand sons are his; his dominions extend throughout the earth to its ocean bounds; and is established not by the scourge, nor by the sword, but by righteousness. Particulars are found chiefly in the Mahāsudassana, Mahāpadāna, Cakkavattisīhanāda, Bālapaṇḍita and Ambaṭṭha Suttas. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.98</c> 
               <br/>From the Mahāpadāna Sutta it would appear that the birth of a Cakkavatti is attended by the same miracles as that of the birth of a Buddha.<br/>Of the Seven Treasures of a Cakkavatti, the Cakkaratana is the chief. After the Wheel, other Treasures make their appearance: first the Elephant, Hatthiratana; it is either the youngest of the Chaddantā-kula or the oldest of the Uposatha-kula. Next the Horse, Assaratana, named Valāhaka, all white with crow black head, and dark mane, able to fly through the air. Then the Veḷuriya-gem from Vepullapabbata, with eight facets, the finest of its species, shedding light for a league around. This is followed by the Woman, belonging either to the royal family of Madda or of Uttarakuru, desirable in every way, both because of her physical beauty and her virtuous character. Then the Treasurer possessed of marvellous vision, enabling him to discover treasures, and then the Adviser, who is generally the Cakkavatti’s eldest son. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.174f.</c> 
               <br/>Judging from the story of Mahāsudassana, who is the typical Cakkavatti, the World emperor has also four other gifts: a marvellous figure, a life longer than that of other men, good health, and popularity with all classes of his subjects. The perfume of sandalwood issues from his mouth, while his body is like a lily. When the Cakkavatti is about to die the Wheel slips down from its place and sinks down slightly. When the king sees this he leaves the household life, and retires into homelessness, to taste the joys of contemplation, having handed over the kingdom to his eldest son.<br/>A Cakkavatti is as worthy of a thūpa as a Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.143</c>

               <br/>A lay-disciple of the Buddha in Sāvatthī. He was present when five rājās, including Pasenadi, visited the Buddha and asked him which was the highest sensual pleasure. When the Buddha had answered their question, Candanaṅgalika obtained his permission and uttered averse in his praise. The rājās thereupon gave Candanangala five robes which he presented to the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.81f.</c>

               </b>
               <br/>King of Avanti in the time of the Buddha. His name was Pajjota, the sobriquet being added on account of his violent temper.<br/>Once, when ill with jaundice, he asked Bimbisāra to lend him the services of Jīvaka, as no other doctor could cure him. The cure for the malady was ghee, for which Pajjota had a strong aversion. Jīvaka, therefore, decided to administer it disguised in an astringent decoction, and obtained the king’s permission to use any of the royal animals or to leave the city at any time he wished, on the plea that he must go in search of various medicines. When all preparations were complete, Jīvaka gave the king the medicine and escaped on Bhaddavatikā, the king’s she-elephant, before the truth was discovered. The king sent Kāka in pursuit, but Jīvaka gave Kāka a purgative and so delayed his return until the medicine had taken effect on the king. Later, when Pajjota was cured, he sent Jīvaka many costly presents, including a garment of Siveyyaka cloth. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.276ff.</c> 
               <br/>Pajjota was the friend of Bimbisāra, and when the latter was put to death by Ajātasattu, Pajjota seems to have made preparations to wage war on Ajātasattu. The defences of Rājagaha were strengthened to meet the threatened attack, but nothing further happened. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.iii.7</c>

               <br/>He was a friend of Poṭṭhapāda, and when he had returned for the sixth time to a householder’s life, Poṭṭhapāda brought him to the Buddha. Citta listened to their conversation and asked questions regarding personality. At the end of the discourse Citta once more joined the Order, never again to leave it, for he soon after became an arahant. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.199ff.</c>

There Cunda visited him and invited him and the monks to a meal the next day. The meal consisted of sweet rice and cakes and sūkaramaddava. At the meal the Buddha ordered that he alone should be served with sūkaramaddava, and that what was left over should be buried in a hole. This was the Buddha’s last meal, as very soon after it he developed dysentery.<c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.126</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.viii.5</c>  The Buddha, a little while before his death, gave special instructions to Ānanda that he should visit Cunda and reassure him by telling him that no blame at all attached to him and that he should feel no remorse, but should, on the contrary, rejoice, in that he had been able to give to the Buddha a meal which, in merit, far exceeded any other. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.135f.</c> 
               <br/>The Aṅguttara Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.263ff.</c>  mentions another conversation between the Buddha and Cunda. Cunda tells the Buddha that he approves of the methods of purification laid down by the brahmins of the west (pacchābhūmakā) The Buddha tells him of the teaching of the Ariyans regarding the threefold defilement and purification of the body, the fourfold defilement and purification of the speech, and the threefold defilement and purification of the mind. Cunda accepts the Buddha’s explanations and declares himself his follower.<br/>

One day, at the end of the lesson, he overheard their remarks, and forthwith gave an exhibition of his magical powers and of his wide knowledge of the Buddha’s teachings. The nuns listened with great admiration until after sunset, when they were unable to gain entrance to the city. The Buddha heard of this and warned Cūḷapanthaka not to keep the nuns so late.<br/>The Udāna <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.v.10</c>  contains a verse sung by the Buddha in praise of Cūḷapanthaka.<br/>

When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he decreed that the ukkhepaniya-kamma be carried out against him, forbidding him to eat or dwell with the Saṅgha.

               </b> Jīvakakomārabhacca<br/>A celebrated physician, and the Buddha’s doctor. The Vinaya contains many stories of his skill in healing. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.268–281</c>  Once when the Buddha was ill, Jīvaka found it necessary to administer a purge, and he had fat rubbed into the Buddha’s body and gave him a handful of lotuses to smell. Jīvaka was away when the purgative acted, and suddenly remembered that he had omitted to ask the Buddha to bathe in warm water to complete the cure. The Buddha read his thoughts and bathed as required. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.279f.</c> 
               <br/>Jīvaka’s fame as a physician brought him more work than he could cope with, but he never neglected his duties to the Saṅgha. Many people, afflicted with disease and unable to pay for treatment by him, joined the Order in order that they might receive that treatment. On discovering that the Order was thus being made a convenience of, he asked the Buddha to lay down a rule that men afflicted with certain diseases should be refused entry into the Order. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.71ff.</c>  Jīvaka was declared by the Buddha chief among his lay followers loved by the people. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.26</c>  He is included in a list of good men who have been assured of the realisation of deathlessness. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.451</c> 
               <br/>One discussion he had with the Buddha regarding the qualities of a pious lay disciple is recorded in the Aṅguttara Nikāya. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.222f.</c> 
               <br/>At Jīvaka’s request, the Buddha enjoined upon monks to take exercise; Jīvaka had gone to Vesāli on business and had noticed their pale, unhealthy look. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.119</c>

On the death of Govinda, Jotipāla became chaplain to Disampati. He inspired Reṇu’s six companions to wait on Reṇu and make him promise to share the kingdom with them when he should come to the throne. This promise Reṇu kept when he succeeded his father and appointed Jotipāla to carry out the division of the kingdom, which the latter duly did. All the kings wished Jotipāla to be their chaplain, and he instructed them in the art of government, teaching the mantras also to seven eminent brahmins and to seven hundred young graduates. Jotipāla himself came to be known as Mahā Govinda.<br/>After some time, Jotipāla took leave of the seven kings, his disciples and his wives, and spent the four months of the rainy season in a retired spot outside the city, developing jhāna in order to see Brahmā face to face. At the end of the four months, Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appeared before him and gave him a boon. Jotipāla asked to be taught the way to reach the Brahma-world, and, having listened to Sanaṅkumāra’s exposition, decided to leave the world. The kings and all the others did their best to make him desist from this course, but finding their efforts of no avail they went with him into the homeless life, where all of them profited thereby.<br/>Jotipāla was the Buddha in a previous life. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.232–251</c>  He is twice mentioned in the Aṅguttara Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.372</c>

               </b>
               <br/>A Pacceka Buddha, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.iii.69</c>  third among the five hundred sons of Padumavatī, all of whom became Pacceka Buddhas. Suppabuddha, a banker of Rājagaha, having seen the Pacceka Buddha on his way to a park, spoke insultingly to him, and, as a result, was born as a leper in this birth. <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.v.3</c> 
               <br/>The Saṃyutta Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.92f.</c>  contains the story of a man who often met Tagarasikhī begging for alms. One day, being attracted by him, he asked his wife to give him a meal and went on his way. His wife prepared excellent food and gave it to Tagarasikhī. The husband met Tagarasikhī on his way back to the town, and seeing the excellence of the food, was displeased with his wife’s generosity, thinking to himself that it were better that slaves and workmen should have eaten the food. As a result, he was born as a very rich seṭṭhi in Sāvatthī, but was never able to enjoy his wealth, and died intestate, all his possessions passing to the royal treasury.<br/>

               </b>
               <br/>A region in India. It contained the city of Vedisa. Dakkhiṇāgiri lay to the south-west of Rājagaha, beyond the hills that surrounded the city—hence its name. In the district was the brahmin village of Ekanālā.<c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.p.13</c>  The Buddha traversed it in the course of his periodical tours through Māgadha, residing in the Dakkhiṇāgiri monastery in Ekanālā.<c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.172</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.80</c>  It was during one of these tours that he converted Kasī-Bhāradvāja and Dhammasava and his father. On another of these occasions the Buddha saw the Magadhakhetta, which gave him the idea of designing the robe of a monk to resemble a field <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.287</c>  Ānanda is also said to have travelled through Dakkhiṇāgiri, gathering a large number of young men into the Order, who, however, do not appear to have been very serious in their intentions, as their behaviour earned for Ānanda the censure of Mahā Kassapa. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.217f.</c>  Later, we find Puṇṇa with a large following in Dakkhiṇāgiri refusing to join in the findings of the Rājagaha Council, and preferring to follow the Dhamma according to his own lights. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.289</c> 
               <br/>Dakkhiṇāgiri was the residence of Nandamātā of Velukantaka and she was visited both by Sāriputta and by Moggallāna during a tour in the district. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.64</c>  In Dakkhiṇāgiri, Sāriputta heard of the lack of zeal of Dhānañjāni. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.185</c>

               </b>
               <br/>In the old Pāḷi literature the name Dakkhiṇāpatha would seem to indicate only a remote settlement or colony on the banks of the upper Godāvarī. Thus, we are told that Bāvarī had his hermitage in Dakkhiṇāpatha territory, midway between the kingdoms of Assaka and Alaka. <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.976</c>  Elsewhere the name is coupled with Avanti as Avantidakkhiṇāpatha and seems to refer, but more vaguely, to the same limited district. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.195</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.196</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.298</c> 
               <br/>In <c c="#3b6bd3">J.v.133</c> , however, Avanti is spoken of as a part of Dakkhinapatha (Dakkhinupathe Avantirattha), but see <c c="#3b6bd3">J.iii.463</c> , where Avantidakkhinapatha is spoken of.<br/>The Sutta Nipata Commentary <c c="#3b6bd3">ii.580</c>  seems to explain Dakkhinapatha as the road leading to the Dakkhinajanapada, while the Sumangala Vilasini <c c="#3b6bd3">DA.i.265</c>  takes Dakkhinapatha to be synonymous with Dakkhinajanapada and says that it was the district (janapada) south of the Ganges (Gangaya dakkhinato pakatajanapadam).<br/>It is clear that, in the earlier literature at any rate, the word did not mean the whole country comprised in the modern word Dekkhan. It is possible that Dakkhinapatha was originally the name of the road which led southwards - the Aryan settlement at the end of the road, on the banks of the Godavari being also called by the same name - and that later the road lent its name to the whole region through which it passed. (For a detailed description see Law: Geog. of Early Buddhism, pp.60ff). In the Petavatthu Commentary <c c="#3b6bd3">PvA., p.133</c>  the Damila country (Damilavisaya) is included in the Dakkhinapatha.<br/>The Dakkhinapatha is famous in literature as the birthplace of strong bullocks <c c="#3b6bd3">DhSA.141</c> ; <c c="#3b6bd3">NidA.16</c> ; <c c="#3b6bd3">DhA.iii.248</c> , etc.). It held also a large number of ascetics <c c="#3b6bd3">DA.i.265</c> , and in the southern districts (Dakkhinesu janapadesu) people celebrated a feast called Dharana <c c="#3b6bd3">A.v.216</c> .

               <br/>An arahant. With the Buddha’s sanction, and wishing to be of service to the Order, he took upon himself the task of appointing night’s-lodgings to travelling monks and of directing them to meals. He performed his duties most diligently and with great intelligence, and his fame spread far and wide. Monks coming from afar, wishing to witness his skill, would deliberately arrive late and ask for lodgings in some place remote from Rājagaha; Dabba would “burst into flame” and walk ahead of them, with his finger burning to light them on the way.<br/>It once happened that meals were allotted by Dabba to the Mettiya-Bhummajakā at the house of a rich man, who, discovering their identity, gave orders that they were to be fed anyhow. The Mettiya-Bhummajakā were greatly offended, and believing that Dabba had intended to slight them, induced one of their partisans, Mettiyā, to accuse Dabba of having seduced her. The charge was investigated, Mettiyā was expelled, and Dabba’s fame increased.<c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.5</c>

               <br/>Dabba was given the rank of chief of those who appointed lodgings. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.24</c> 
               <br/>Dabba evidently died young. The Udāna <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.viii.9</c>  contains an account of his death. One day, returning from his alms rounds in Rājagaha, he saw that he had but a short while yet to live. He went, therefore, to the Buddha and, with his leave, showed various iddhi-powers and passed away.<br/>

Dīghāyu was sent away from the city lest harm should befall him, Later, Dīghīti’s place of refuge was discovered and he and his wife were being led to the place of execution when Dīghāyu, who was on a visit to the city, saw them. Dīghīti, recognising his son, called to him his dying advice “look not too far nor too near”. Dīghāyu heard and understood; he entered the service of Brahmadatta, first as an elephant-trainer, then as a musician, and finally as his personal servant. He wished to avenge the death of his parents, but when the occasion arose, he remembered his father’s instructions and desisted. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.342ff.</c>

                  <c c="#a00149">Devadatta</c>
               </b>
               <br/>A monk, a close relative of the Buddha, who split the Sangha, and attempted to overthrow the Buddha and have him murdered. In one passage in the Vinaya, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.189</c>  Devadatta is spoken of as Godhiputta, the son of Godhi.<br/>When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu after the Enlightenment and preached to the Sākiyans, Devadatta was converted together with his friends Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, and their barber, Upāli, and he sought the Buddha at Anupiya and entered the Order. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.182</c>  During the rainy season that followed, Devadatta acquired the power of iddhi possible to those who are yet of the world puthujjānika-iddhi. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.183</c>  Sāriputta is mentioned as having gone about Rājagaha singing Devadatta’s praises. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.189</c>  Devadatta was later suspected of evil wishes. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.156</c>  About eight years before the Buddha’s death, Devadatta, eager for gain and favour and jealous of the Buddha’s fame, attempted to win over Ajātasattu. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.184ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.171f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.174f.</c>

               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.160</c> 
               <br/>He assumed the form of a child having a girdle of snakes, and suddenly appeared on Ajātasattu’s lap, frightening him. He then resumed his own form, and Ajātasattu, much impressed, paid him great honour and, it is said, visited him morning and evening with five hundred chariots and sent him daily five hundred dishes of food.<br/>Sometime later, Devadatta went to the Buddha and suggested that the leadership of the Order should be handed over to him in view of the Buddha’s approaching old age. The Buddha scorned the suggestion, saying, “Not even to Sāriputta or Moggallāna would I hand over the Order, and would I then to thee, vile one, to be vomited like spittle?” <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.188</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.393</c>  Devadatta showed great resentment and vowed vengeance. Thereupon, at the Buddha’s suggestion, a proclamation was issued to the Saṅgha that in anything done by Devadatta in the name of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha, none but Devadatta was to be recognised.<br/>It was at this time that Devadatta incited Ajātasattu to kill his father, Bimbisāra, while he himself prepared to kill the Buddha. Ajātasattu agreed, and provided Devadatta with royal archers to shoot the Buddha. These were placed on different paths, one on one path, two on another, and so on up to sixteen, and the plan was so laid that not one of them would survive to tell the tale. But when the Buddha approached the first man, he was terrified by the Buddha’s majesty, and his body became stiff. The Buddha spoke kindly to him, and the man, throwing away his weapons, confessed his intended crime. The Buddha thereupon preached to him and, having converted him, sent him back by a different path. The other groups of archers, tired of waiting, gave up the vigil and went away one after the other. The different groups were led to the Buddha by his iddhi-power, and he preached to them and converted them. The first man returned to Devadatta saying that he was unable to kill the Buddha because of his great iddhi-power.<br/>Devadatta then decided to kill the Buddha himself. One day, when the Buddha was walking on the slopes of Gijjhakūṭa, he hurled down on him a great rock. Two peaks sprang up from the ground, thereby arresting its rushing advance, but a splinter struck the Buddha’s foot, causing the blood to flow. Being in great pain, he was carried to Maddakucchi, and from there to Jīvaka’s Ambavana, where Jīvaka attended him. After this event, the monks wished the Buddha to have a guard, but this he refused, saying that it was impossible for anyone to deprive a Tathāgata of his life.<br/>Devadatta’s next attempt on the Buddha’s life was to persuade elephant-keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nalāgiri (or Dhanapāla), drunk with toddy, on to the road by which the Buddha would pass. The news spread rapidly, and the Buddha was warned, but refused to turn back. As the elephant advanced he pervaded it with love, and thus completely subdued it.<br/>This outrage made Devadatta very unpopular, and even Ajātasattu was compelled by the force of public opinion to withdraw his patronage from Devadatta, whose gain and honour decreased. Thereupon he decided, with the help of several others, Kokālika, Katamoraka-tissa, Khaṇḍadeviyāputta and Samuddadatta, to bring about a schism in the Order. These five went accordingly to the Buddha and asked for the imposition of five rules on all members of the Saṅgha.<br/>that monks should dwell all their lives in the forest, that they should accept no invitations to meals, but live entirely on alms obtained by begging, that they should wear only robes made of discarded rags and accept no robes from the laity, that they should dwell at the foot of a tree and not under a roof,  that they should abstain completely from fish and flesh. The Buddha’s reply was that those who felt so inclined could follow these rules—except that of sleeping under a tree during the rainy season—but he refused to make the rules obligatory. This refusal delighted Devadatta, who went about with his party, declaring that the Buddha was prone to luxury and abundance. He was believed by the foolish, and in spite of the Buddha’s warning against the dire sin of causing schism in the Order, Devadatta informed Ānanda of his intention of holding an uposatha meeting without the Buddha, and, having persuaded five hundred newly ordained monks from Vesāli to join him, he went out to Gayāsīsa. Three suttas, the two Devadatta, and the Mahāsāropama, were preached after this event.<br/>The Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to Gayāsīsa to bring back the deluded ones. Devadatta, believing that they had come to join him, rejoiced, and, in spite of Kokālika’s warning, welcomed them. That night he preached very late to the monks, and, wishing for rest, asked Sāriputta to address the assembly. Sāriputta and Moggallāna preached to such effect that they persuaded the five hundred monks to return with them. Kokālika kicked Devadatta on the chest to awaken him and tell him the news. When Devadatta discovered what had happened, hot blood came from his mouth, and for nine months he lay grievously ill.<br/>As his end drew near, he wished to see the Buddha, though the latter had declared that it would not be possible in this life. Devadatta, however, started the journey on a litter, but on reaching Jetavana, he stopped the litter on the banks of the pond and stepped out to wash. The earth opened and he was swallowed up in Avīci.<br/>Only once is mention made <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.402f.</c>  of the text of a sermon by Devadatta. Candikāputta reports this to Sāriputta, who makes it an occasion for a talk to the monks.<br/>

               <br/>A brahmin of Sāvatthī. Once when the Buddha was ill with cramp and desired hot water Upavāna obtained from Devahita hot water and molasses, which he sent on a pingo by a serving man. Hot fomentations and the administering of molasses cured the Buddha’s complaint. Devahita came later to the Buddha, and after some conversation he was converted. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.174f.</c>

               <br/>A brahmin. He was at Kusinārā at the time of the Buddha’s death, and it was his intervention which prevented a quarrel among the kings who assembled there to claim the Buddha’s relics. He pointed out to them the impropriety of a quarrel over anything connected with the Buddha, the teacher of Peace. The claimants thereupon asked Doṇa to undertake the distribution of the relics. He divided them into eight parts, one of which he gave to each king. He himself kept the vessel used for collecting and dividing the relics, and over it he built a thūpa, celebrating a feast in its honour. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.166f.</c> 
               <br/>Doṇa first met the Buddha on the road between Ukkaṭṭha and Setavyā. He saw the Buddha’s footprints and, following them, he came upon the Buddha seated at the foot of a-tree. Doṇa asked him various questions as to his identity and the Buddha explained to him his Buddha-hood. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.37f.</c>

He continued to live there after the others had left. While he was away begging for alms, his hut was pulled down by women searching for straw and firewood, but he rebuilt it. Three times this happened, until, in exasperation, Dhaniya very skilfully made bricks and tiles and built a hut both strong and splendid, with tiles of shining crimson which gave out a bell-like sound when tapped. The Buddha, seeing this, chided Dhaniya and ordered the hut to be pulled down. Dhaniya then built a hut of wood which he obtained from a guild of timber merchants, suppliers of wood to the king, giving them to understand that he had the king’s permission. Vassakāra, hearing of this, reported the matter to Bimbisāra, who sent for Dhaniya. Dhaniya maintained that the king, by royal proclamation, had permitted the monks to use the royal supplies of wood and other materials. Bimbisāra admitted the proclamation, but said it referred only to supplies straight from the forest, and he sent Dhaniya away with a warning. The matter created a great uproar and the Buddha blamed Dhaniya. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.41–5</c>

               </b>  Naṅgaraka<br/>A Sākyan township near Medatalumpa. From there Pasenadi, accompanied by Dīgha-Kārāyana, paid his last visit to the Buddha, as recorded in the Dhammacetiya Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.118</c> 
               <br/>The Buddha evidently once stayed in Nagaraka, for in the Cūḷa-Suññatā Sutta, Ānanda is reported as reminding the Buddha that once, while staying at Nagaraka, the Buddha had remarked that he lived “with the Void a great deal.”<br/>

The Buddha shows him the bauty of the celestial nymphs, beside whom his beloved looked like a scalded she-monkey with nose and ears cut off. The Buddha promised Nanda 500 such nymphs if he were to stay as a monk. He remained in robes, but later became ashamed of his purpose and practiced sincerely, attaining arahantship. <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.iii.2</c>  His Theragāthā verses speak of his struggle with desire. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.157f.</c>

Discovering this, the Buddha chided him for his presumption. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.173</c>  Another time Nanda is said to have donned a robe which was pressed on both sides, painted his face, and gone to see the Buddha, carrying a bright bowl.

She met him begging alms in Savatthi and smiled to him with sinful heart.<br/>The Aṅguttara Nikāya attributes two discourses to Nandaka. The first <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.193f.</c>  was preached at the Migāramātupāsāda and takes the form of a discussion with Sāḷha, Migāra’s grandson, and Rohana, Pekkhuniya’s grandson on greed, covetousness, malice and delusion, and the benefits following their destruction. The second discourse is a sermon addressed to the monks at the waiting hall at Jetavana. It is said that the Buddha was attracted to the spot by the sound of Nandaka’s preaching, and, finding the door locked, stood for a long time outside, listening. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.358ff.</c>  When his back began to ache he knocked at the door, and, having entered, told Nandaka that he had been waiting until the end of his discourse to speak to him. Nandaka expressed. his regret that he should have kept the Buddha waiting and pleaded ignorance of his presence. The Buddha, conscious of Nandaka’s remorse, went on to praise his sermon, and said that the preaching of such sermons was the duty of all pious monks. When the Buddha left, Nandaka resumed his sermon, and told his audience of the five results of listening to the Dhamma in due season.<br/>

Once, when the Buddha was staying in a forest in Kosala, Navakammika, who was there seeing about some timber work, saw the Buddha at the foot of a tree and asked him what pleasure he found in his contemplations. When the Buddha explained to him how he had found liberty, the Brahmin was pleased and accepted the Buddha as his teacher. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.179</c>

               <br/>He was a Sākiyan and entered the Order when the Buddha visited his kinsmen at Kapilavatthu. For some time he was the Buddha’s personal attendant—e.g., when the Buddha breached the Mahāsīhanāda Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.83</c> 
               <br/>One day, when entering the city for alms, he saw a nautch girl gaily dressed, dancing to the accompaniment of music and contemplated her as the snare of Māra. Making this his topic of thought, he developed insight into the perishableness of life and became an arahant. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.267–270</c>  Another day, while walking with the Buddha, they came to a cleft in the road, and the Buddha wished to go along one way, while Nāgasamāla wished to go along another, in spite of the Buddha’s warning that it was dangerous. In the end, he put the Buddha’s begging bowl and robe on the ground and left him. Brigands waylaid him and ill treated him, breaking his bowl and threatening to kill him. Thereupon he turned back to the Buddha and asked his forgiveness. <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.viii.7</c>

               <br/>A class of beings classed with Garuḷas and Supaṇṇas and playing a prominent part in Buddhist folk lore. They are gifted with miraculous powers and great strength. Generally speaking, they are confused with snakes, chiefly the hooded Cobra, and their bodies are described as being those of snakes, though they can assume human form at will. The Vinaya <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.109</c>  contains a list of four royal families of Nāgas (Ahirājakulāni): Virūpakkha, Erāpatha, Chabyāputta and Kaṇhāgotamaka. The enmity between the Nāgas and the Garulas is proverbial. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.258</c>  In the Aṭāṇātiya Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.198f.</c>  speaking of dwellers of the Cātummahārajika world, the Nāgas are mentioned as occupying the Western Quarter, with Virūpakkha as their king.<br/>The word Nāga is often used as an epithet of the Buddha and the Arahants.<br/>In the accounts given of the Nāgas, there is undoubtedly great confusion between the Nāgas as supernatural beings, as snakes, elephants, and as the name of certain non Aryan tribes, but the confusion is too difficult to unravel.<br/>

               </b> Nāḷāgiri<br/>An elephant of the royal stalls at Rājagaha. Devadatta, after several vain attempts to kill the Buddha, obtained Ajātasattu’s consent to use Nālagiri as a means of encompassing the Buddha’s death. Nālagiri was a fierce animal, and in order to increase his fierceness, Devadatta instructed his keeper to give him twice his usual amount of toddy. Proclamation was made, by the beating of drums, that the streets of the city should be cleared as Nālāgiri would be let loose upon them. When the Buddha was informed of this and warned against going into the city for alms, he ignored the warning, and went into Rājagaha with the monks of the eighteen monasteries of the city. At the sight of Nālāgiri all the people fled in terror. Ānanda, seeing the elephant advancing towards the Buddha, went, in spite of the Buddha’s orders to the contrary, and stood in front of the Buddha, who had to make use of his supernatural power to remove him from his place. The Buddha spoke to him, suffusing him with all the love at his command, and, stretching out his right hand, he stroked the animal’s forehead. Thrilling with joy at the touch, Nālāgiri sank on his knees before the Buddha. The Buddha returned to Veḷuvana. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.194f.</c>

               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.214ff.</c>  It is curious, in view of this statement of Nāṭaputta’s doctrine of inaction, that the main ground on which he is stated to have objected to Sīha’s visit to the Buddha, was that the Buddha was an akiriyavādī. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.180</c> 
               <br/>He taught that past deeds should be extirpated by severe austerities, fresh deeds should be avoided by inaction. By expelling through penance all past misdeeds and by not committing fresh misdeeds, the future became cleared. From the destruction of deeds results the destruction of dukkha; this leads to the destruction of vedanā. Thus all dukkha is exhausted and one passes beyond the round of existence. It is said that Nāṭaputta did not employ the term kamma in his teaching; he used, instead, the word daṇḍa; and that, according to him, the daṇḍa of deed was far more criminal than the dandas of word and mind. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.371</c> 
               <br/>He is said to have shown no hesitation in declaring the destinies of his disciples after death <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.398</c>  ; but Sakuludāyi says <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.31</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.93</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.214f.</c>  that when asked a question as to the past, he skipped from one matter to another and dismissed the question, evincing irritation, bad temper and resentment.<br/>Only one discussion is recorded between Nāṭaputta and a follower of the Buddha, and that was with Citta gahapati at Macchika Sanda. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.298ff.</c>  He praises Citta at the outset of the discussion, holding him up as an example to his own flock, and agreeing with Citta that knowledge is more excellent than faith. But later, when Citta claims knowledge of the four jhānas, Nāṭaputta is represented as condemning him for a deceitful man. Citta, thereupon, asks him ten questions and, getting no answer, leaves him.<br/>The Devadaha Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.214</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.91ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.150</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.119</c>  contains a detailed analysis and attributed to the Buddha, of the beliefs and teachings of the Nigaṇṭhas. He there selects for his condemnation ten of their operative utterances, major and minor, and proves that the efforts and strivings of the Nigaṇṭhas are fruitless.<br/>The books contain the names of several disciples of Nāṭaputta, among them a deva called Ninka. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.66</c>  Nāṭaputta is so convinced of the truth and the irrefutableness of his own doctrines, that he actually encourages his disciples to hold discussions with the Buddha. Some, like Dīgha Tapassī, come away unscathed, without having carried the discussion to any conclusion; others are mentioned as being convinced by the Buddha in the end and as becoming his disciples. Such, for instance, are Asibandhakaputta <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.317ff.</c>  and Abhayarājakumāra. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.392ff.</c>  Nāṭaputta tries, without success, to dissuade Sīha, general of the Licchavis, from visiting the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.180ff.</c>  Sīha goes and is converted. The next day he holds an almsgiving, on a grand scale, to the Buddha and his monks, at which flesh is served. It is said that Nāṭaputta went about Vesāli, sneering at the Buddha for encouraging slaughter. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.233ff.</c> 
               <br/>But the greatest blow to Nāṭaputta was when Upāli-gahapati <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.373ff.</c>  joined the Buddha. Nāṭaputta had allowed Upāli to visit him in spite of the warning of Dīgha-Tapassī as to the Buddha’s arresting personality. But Nāṭaputta thought Upāli would be proof against it, and, on hearing that he had renounced his allegiance to the Nigaṇṭhas, refused to believe it until he could verify the information himself. The discovery of the apostasy of Upāli prostrated him with grief.; he vomited hot blood and had to be carried away on a litter from Bālaka, where he was then living, to Pāvā. There, soon after, he died, and immediately great dissensions arose among his followers. When the Buddha heard of the quarrels, he remarked that it was only to be expected. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.243f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.117</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.210</c> 
               <br/>Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta is the name by which the Jaina teacher, Mahāvīra, was known to his contemporaries. He was also called Vardhamāna. Nāta was the name of his clan.<br/>

In the Sāmaññaphala Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.56</c>  Ajātasattu is said to have visited him and obtained from him an exposition of his teaching, which was to the effect that the four elements—earth, fire, air, water; pleasure, pain, and the soul—these seven things were eternally existent and unchangeable in their very nature; that there is no volitional activity of consciousness in them. His doctrine is, therefore, one of non action. When one, with a sharp sword, cleaves a head in twain, no one is thereby deprived of life, a sword has merely penetrated into the interval between seven elementary substances. In other words, there is no such act as killing, or hearing, or knowing, etc.; no conceptions of, or distinction between, good and bad, knowledge and ignorance, etc.<br/>Pakudha’s teachings are also referred to in the Sandaka Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.517</c>  and there described at even greater length, but here his name is not mentioned.<br/>We are told <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.250</c>

                  <c c="#a00149">Paribbājakā</c>
               </b>
               <br/>Wanderer. The name given to some of the ascetics and recluses of the Buddha’s time. They were not exclusively brahmin. Their presence seems to have been recognized and respected from earlier times. Generally speaking, their creed is formulated as a belief in perfect bliss after death for the self purged from evil, and as a conviction that this bliss can be won by brahmacariyā, by freedom from all evil in acts, words, aims, and mode of livelihood. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.24</c> 
               <br/>All these four standards of conduct were bodily incorporated in the Buddha’s Noble Eightfold Path, and the last of the four gave to the Ājīvakas their specific name as a separate sect. The Paribbājakas claimed to be identical with the followers of the Buddha in their tenets and teaching, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.64f</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.84f.</c>  but the Buddha maintained that the two teachings were quite distinct. This is clearly indicated <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.39</c>  in connection with the conversion of Sāriputta and Moggallāna, who were Paribbājakas under Sañjaya. The goal of the Paribbājakas was deathlessness which, to them, probably meant birth in the world of Brahmā. Their conversion to the Buddha’s Doctrine followed the recognition that Gotama dealt, not with effects but with causes, and that he went to the root of the matter by teaching how casual states of consciousness arose and how they could be banished for ever. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.35ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.378</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.215</c> 
               <br/>The Paribbājakas were not ascetics except in so far as they were celibates; some of them were women. They were teachers or sophists who spent eight or nine months of every year wandering from place to place for the purpose of engaging in friendly, conversational discussions on matters of ethics and philosophy, nature lore and mysticism. They differed very much in intelligence, earnestness, and even in honesty. Some of the views discussed in the Brahmajāla Sutta, for instance, and described as those of “Eel wrigglers” and “Hair splitters”, were undoubtedly truly thus described. The books mention halls erected for the accommodation of the Paribbājakas, such as those in Mallikā’s park at Sāvatthī, <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.178</c>  and the Kūṭāgārasālā at Vesāli.<br/>Sometimes special places were set apart for them in the groves near the settlements, as at Campā on the bank of the Gaggarā lake, <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.111</c>  at the Moranivāpa in Rājagaha, <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.326</c>  and on the banks of the Sappinikā. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.185</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.175</c> 
               <br/>It was in such places that the Paribbājakas met each other, and in the course of their journeys they would visit each other in order to exchange greetings of courtesy and to engage in profitable discussion.

               <br/>A naked ascetic of Vesāli who went about claiming to have greater mystic powers than the Buddha, and thereby much impressed Sunakkhatta. Pātikaputta had prophesied that, after death, the Licchavi general Ajita would be born in Mahā Niraya, but Ajita was born in Tāvatiṃsā and accused Pātikaputta of being a liar. Later, the Buddha visited the hermitage of Pātikaputta, with a large following, in order to refute his claims, but Pātikaputta avoided him and went to the Tindukhānuparibbājakārāma. A message was sent to him asking him to come as the Buddha was at his hermitage, but Pātikaputta was unable to arise from his seat. Thereupon, a Licchavi minister, and, after him, Jāliya Dārupattikantevāsī, went to fetch him, but on discovering that he could not rise, they reviled him for his boastfulness. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.13ff.</c>

               </b>
               <br/>The name given to a set of rules to be observed by members of the Buddhist Order. The rules regulate the behaviour of the members of the Order towards one another in respect of clothes, dwellings, furniture, etc., held in common. Transgression of the four pārājikas entails permanent expulsion, of the thirteen saṅghādisesas entails suspension, of the thirty nissaggiya pācittiya entails forfeiture of some possession with confession, while the rest entail a confession only.<br/>The texts speak of a set of 150 rules, <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.231–232</c>  but the current list in Pali has 227. Perhaps the sekhiya were not originally recited.<br/>The Pātimokkha is not included in the extant Buddhist Canon. The rules are included, in the Sutta Vibhaṅga, which contains besides the rules themselves, an old Commentary explaining them and a new Commentary containing further supplementary information concerning them. The rules are divided into two parts: one for the monks and the other for the nuns.<br/>The rules were recited at the gatherings of members of the Order <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.101–136</c>  in their respective districts on uposatha days, the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month. Each section of the rules is recited and, at the end of such recital, the reciter asks the members of the Order who are present if any one of them has infringed any of the rules. Silence implies absence of guilt. This practice of interrupting the recital seems to have been changed later <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.240ff.</c>  even though the old formula, asking the members to speak, continued as a part of the recital.<br/>The word pātimokkha is variously explained, the oldest explanation being that the observance of the rules is the face (mukhaṃ), the chief (pamukhaṃ) of good qualities.<br/>

               <br/>A chieftain of Setavyā, who lived on a royal domain gifted by Pasenadi. He held the view that there was no world other than this, no fruit of actions and no rebirth. But after a discussion with Kūmara Kassapa, who was staying in the Siṃsapāvana near by, he was convinced of the error of his views. Thereupon he instituted an almsgiving to all who sought his generosity. The gifts were, however, coarse and unpalatable. A young brahmin named Uttara, who came to the almsgiving and was passed over, spoke scornfully of the gifts. Hearing of this, Pāyāsi appointed him to supervise the distribution. After death, Pāyāsi was born among the Cātummahārājika gods while Uttara was born in Tāvatiṃsā.<br/> Gavampati met Pāyāsi in the deva world, and Pāyāsi instructed him to teach men to give their gifts with thoroughness and with their own hands. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.316ff.</c>

               </b>
               <br/>The Buddha visited Pātaligāma shortly before his death. Although it later became the capital of Magadha, it was then a mere village. At that time Ajātasattu's ministers, Sunīdha and Vassakāra, were engaged in building fortifications there in order to repel the Vajjīs. The Buddha prophesied the future greatness of Pātaligāma, and also mentioned the danger of its destruction by fire, water, or internal discord. The gate by which the Buddha left the town was called Gotamadvāra, and the ferry at which he crossed the river, Gotamatittha <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.226 30</c> ; <c c="#3b6bd3">D.ii.86ff</c> .<br/>The date at which Pātaliputtta became the capital is uncertain. Hiouen Thsang seems to record (Beal: Records ii.85, n. 11) that it was Kālāsoka who moved the seat of government there. The Jains maintain that it was Udāyi, son of Ajātasattu <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin. Texts ii.102, n. 1</c> . The latter tradition is probably correct as, according to the Anguttara Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">iii.57</c>  even Munda is mentioned as residing at Pātaliputta. It was, however, in the time of Asoka that the city enjoyed its greatest glory. In the ninth year of his reign Asoka's income from the four gates of the city is said to have been four hundred thousand kahāpanas daily, with another one hundred thousand for his sabhā or Council <c c="#3b6bd3">Sp.i.52</c> .<br/>The city was known to the Greeks as Pālibothra, and Megasthenes, who spent some time there, has left a vivid description of it (Buddhist India 262f). It continued to be the capital during the greater part of the Gupta dynasty, from the fourth to the sixth century A.C. Near Pātaliputta was the Kukkutārāma, where monks (e.g. Ananda, Bhadda and Nārada) stayed when they came to Pātaliputta <c c="#3b6bd3">M.i.349</c> ; <c c="#3b6bd3">A.v.341</c> ; <c c="#3b6bd3">A.iii.57</c> ; <c c="#3b6bd3">S.v.15f.</c> , <c c="#3b6bd3">S.v.171f</c> . At the suggestion of Udena Thera, the brahmin Ghotamukha built an assembly hall for the monks in the city <c c="#3b6bd3">M.ii.163</c> .<br/>Pātaligāma was so called because on the day of its foundation several pātali shoots sprouted forth from the ground. The officers of Ajātasattu and of the Licchavi princes would come from time to time to Pātaligāma, drive the people from their houses, and occupy them themselves. A large hall was therefore built in the middle of the village, divided into various apartments for the housing of the officers and their retainers when necessary. The Buddha arrived in the village on the day of the completion of the building, and the villagers invited him to occupy it for a night, that it might be blessed by his presence. On the next day they entertained the Buddha and his monks to a meal <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.viii.6</c> ; <c c="#3b6bd3">UdA.407ff</c> .<br/>

From Pāvā the Buddha journeyed on to Kusinārā, crossing the Kakkuṭṭhā on the way. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.126ff.</c>

               <br/>According to the Saṅgīti Sutta, at the time the Buddha was staying at Pāvā, the Mallas had just completed their new Mote hall, Ubbhataka, and, at their invitation, the Buddha consecrated it by first occupying it and then preaching in it. After the Buddha had finished speaking, Sāriputta recited the Saṅgīti Sutta to the assembled monks.<br/>Pāvā was also a centre of the Nigaṇṭhas and, at the time mentioned above, Nigaṇṭha Nāthaputta had just died at Pāvā and his followers were divided by bitter wrangles. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.210</c>  Cunda Samaṇuddesa was spending his rainy season at Pāvā, and he reported to the Buddha, who was at Sāmagāma, news of the Nigaṇṭhas’ quarrels. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.117f.</c>

               </b> Pilindivaccha Pilindiyavaccha Pilinda Pilindi Pilindiya<br/>A monk whose enigmatic Theragāthā verse speaks of what has come and not departed. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.9</c>  Certain devas who had been born in the deva world as a result of Pilinda’s guidance in a former birth, out of gratitude, waited on him morning and evening. He thus became famous as being dear to the devas, and was declared by the Buddha to be chief among such monks. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.24</c> 
               <br/>Pilinda had a habit of addressing everyone as outcaste. When this was reported to the Buddha he explained that this was because Pilinda had, for one hundred lives, been born among Vasalavādī-Brahmins. <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.iii.6</c> 
               <br/>The Vinaya Pītaka mentions that on several different occasions Pilinda suffered from various ailments and the Buddha had to give permission for the provision of suitable remedies. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.204f.</c> 
               <br/>Once Bimbisāra found Pilinda, clearing a cave in order to provide a cell for himself. The king promised to build a monastery for him if he could obtain the Buddha’s sanction. The permission was obtained and was reported to the king, but he forgot the matter until one hundred days later. On remembering, he made ample amends, gave Pilinda five hundred attendants to look after the monastery, and granted for their maintenance a village, which came to be called Arāmikagāma or Pilindagāma. One day, while in the village for alms, Pilinda went into a house where a girl was weeping because the day was a feast day and she had no ornament to wear, her parents being too poor to afford any. Pilinda gave her a roll of grass to put round her head and it turned instantly into solid gold. The king’s officers, hearing of this wreath, suspected the family of theft and cast them into prison. The next day Pilinda, discovering what had happened, visited the king and convinced him of his iddhi powers by turning the whole palace into gold. The family was released, and the king and his courtiers gave to Pilinda large quantities of the five medicaments, all of which Pilinda distributed among those who wished for them. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.206ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.248ff.</c>  This was the occasion for the forming of the rule that all medicaments required by a monk should be used within seven days.<br/>Another story is related of Pilinda’s iddhi powers. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.67</c>  Once a family of Benares, which was wont to minister to Pilinda, was attacked by robbers and two girls were kidnapped. Pilinda, by his iddhi power caused them to be brought back, and the monks complained of this to the Buddha, but the Buddha held that no wrong had been done.<br/>

               </b> (1) <br/>A prince of the Mallas. He was a disciple of Āḷāra Kālama, and one day, while on his way from Kusinārā to Pāvā, he saw the Buddha seated under a tree by the roadside and stayed to talk to him. He mentioned that once five hundred carts had passed by where Āḷāra sat, and yet so deep was he in meditation that he had failed to notice them. The Buddha told him how, when he himself was in Atumā in the Bhusāgāra, there was a great thunderstorm which killed two peasants and four oxen, but that he had heard and seen nothing, so deep was his concentration. Pukkusa was greatly impressed by this statement, and, having declared himself a follower of the Buddha, he gave to the Buddha two robes of cloth of gold, one of which, at the Buddha’s suggestion, he handed to Ānanda. When Pukkusa had left, Ānanda draped one robe over the Buddha, and was greatly astonished at its pale appearance in comparison with the deep gold of the Buddha’s body. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.130ff.</c>

               <br/>A young monk whom the Buddha met at the house of Bhaggava, the potter, in Rājagaha. Pukkusāti was already occupying the guest room of the house, and the Buddha asked to be allowed to share it, to which Pukkusāti readily agreed. They sat together for sometime in silence, and then the Buddha preached the Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta. Pukkusāti recognised the Buddha at the end of the sermon and begged his forgiveness for not having paid him due honour; he then begged to have the upasampadā conferred on him. The Buddha consented and sent him to procure a begging bowl and a robe. On the way Pukkusāti was gored to death by a mad cow. When this was reported to the Buddha, he said that Pukkusāti was an Anāgāmin and had been born in the realms above, never more to return. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.iii.237–247</c>  In this context Pukkusāti is spoken of as a kulaputta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.iii.238</c>

Ambaṭṭha was the pupil of Pokkharasāti, who sent him to the Buddha at Icchānaṅgala to discover if the report of the Buddha’s greatness were true. When Pokkharasāti heard later that Ambaṭṭha had been rude to the Buddha, he sought the Buddha by night and begged for his forgiveness.

This evidently refers to a time prior to his conversion. The same Sutta mentions a slave girl of Pokkharasāti, Puṇṇikā by name.<br/>

A stage could be reached in which there was no feeling whatever. Samiddhi protested that Potaliputta misinterpreted the Buddha’s teaching, and Potaliputta then asked him questions regarding experience, which Samiddhi answered.

               <br/>A brahmin ascetic who went from Sāvatthī to Dakkhiṇāpatha and lived on the banks of the Godhāvarī in a hermitage which lay half in the territory of Assaka and half in that of Alaka.<br/>He received the revenue of a village near by and held a great sacrifice, spending all he possessed. Then to him came a brahmin of terrible mien, demanding five hundred pieces.<br/>When Bāvari told him of his poverty, the brahmin cursed him saying that his head would split in seven pieces. Bāvarī was greatly distressed, but a devatā, seeing his trouble, reassured him by saying that the brahmin knew neither the meaning of “head” nor of “the splitting of it.” “Who then knows it?” asked Bāvarī, and the devatā told him of the appearance in the world of the Buddha. Forthwith he sent his sixteen pupils—Ajita, Tissametteyya, Puṇṇaka, Mettagū, Dhotaka, Upasīva, Nanda, Hemaka, Todeyya, Kappa, Jatukaṇṇī, Bhadrāvudha, Udaya, Posāla, Mogharāja and Piṅgiya to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha and to find out if his claims to Buddha-hood were justified. The pupils went northward, through Alaka, Patiṭṭhāna, Māhissati, Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya (or Tumbava, v.l. Vanasāvatthi), Kosambī, Sāketa and Sāvatthī; then, finding that the Buddha had gone to Rājagaha, they followed him there to the Pāsāṇaka cetiya, passing through Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā, Bhoganagara and Vesāli. When they arrived before the Buddha, they greeted him in the name of Bāvarī, and being satisfied that he bore the characteristic signs of a Great Being, Ajita asked Bāvarī’s question of the Buddha, and when that had been answered, each of the pupils asked him a question in turn, to which the Buddha replied. <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.976–1148</c>

By the power of the devatā, Bāhiya reached Sāvatthī in one night, a distance of one hundred and twenty leagues, and was told that the Buddha was in the city begging alms. Bāhiya followed him thither and begged to be taught something for his salvation. Twice he asked and twice the Buddha refused, saying that it was not the hour for teaching. But Bāhiya insisted, saying that life was uncertain and that the Buddha or he might die.<br/>The Buddha then taught him the proper method of regarding all sense experiences—namely, as experiences and no more. Even as he listened, Bāhiya became an arahant and the Buddha left him. Shortly after, Bāhiya was gored to death by a cow with calf. The Buddha, seeing his body lying on the dung heap, asked the monks to remove it and to have it burnt, erecting a thūpa over the remains. In the assembly he declared Bāhiya to be foremost among those who instantly comprehended the Truth. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.24</c>

The king, seeing the young ascetic pass below the palace windows, sent messengers after him. On learning, that he was resting after his meal, Bimbisāra followed him and offered him a place in his court. This the Buddha refused, revealing his identity. The Buddha returned to Rājagaha immediately after his conversion of the Tebhātika Jaṭilā. He stayed at the Supatiṭṭha cetiya in Latthivanuyyāna, whither Bimbisāra, accompanied by twelve nahutas of householders, went to pay to him his respects. The Buddha preached to them, and eleven nahutas, with Bimbisāra at their head, became sotāpannas. On the following day the Buddha and his large retinue of monks accepted the hospitality of Bimbisāra. At the conclusion of the meal, Bimbisāra poured water from a golden jar on the Buddha’s hand and dedicated Veḷuvana for the use of him and of his monks. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.35ff.</c>

On his way from Andhakkavinda to Rājagaha he met the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree, and, with his permission, presented a pot of sugar to the monks.

               <br/>He lived at Suṃsumāragiri in the Bhagga country and built a palace called Kokanada. When the palace was completed, the Buddha was staying at Bhesakalāvana near by, and Bodhi sent a message by Sañjikāputta, inviting the Buddha to the palace, that he might bless it by being its first occupant. The Buddha agreed to come and, the next day, arrived with the monks for a meal. Bodhi came, with his retinue, to meet them at the foot of the steps and asked the Buddha to step on to the carpeting which was spread there. Three times the request was made, three times the Buddha kept silence. Thereupon Ānanda asked for the carpeting to be removed, saying that the Buddha’s refusal to step thereon was as an example to future generations. After the meal, Bodhi had a discussion with the Buddha, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.127f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.91ff.</c>  recorded in the Bodhirājakumāra Sutta.<br/>Bodhi was the son of Udena, king of Kosambi, and his mother was the daughter of Candappajjota. Bodhi was skilled in the art of managing elephants, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.94</c>  which art he learned from his father, a master in this direction. It is said <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.97</c>  that, while Bodhi was yet in his mother’s womb, she visited the Buddha at the Ghositārāma in Kosambī and declared that whatever child was born to her it would accept the Buddha, his teaching and the Order, as its abiding refuge. Later, after Bodhi’s birth, his nurse took him to the Buddha at Bhesakalāvana and made a similar declaration. When, therefore, Bodhi acknowledged the Buddha as his teacher, at the conclusion of the Bodhirājakumāra Sutta, he was seeking the Buddha’s refuge for the third time.<br/>

Uttara therefore visited the Buddha and, having seen the thirty two marks, resolved to observe the Buddha in his every posture and, to this end, followed him about for seven months. He then returned to Brahmāyu and told him of the result of his investigations. Brahmāyu folded his palms reverently and uttered the praises of the Buddha. Soon after, the Buddha came to Mithilā and took up his residence in the Makhādeva mango grove. Brahmāyu, having sent a messenger to announce his arrival, visited the Buddha.<br/>He satisfied any remaining doubts he had as to the marks on the Buddha’s body and then proceeded to ask him questions on various topics. At the end of the discussion he fell at the Buddha’s feet, stroking them and proclaiming his name. The Buddha asked him to compose himself, and preached to him on “progressive” discourse. Brahmāyu invited the Buddha and his monks to his house, where he entertained them for a week. His death occurred not long after, and the Buddha, when told of it, said that Brahmāyu had become an Anāgāmī. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.133ff.</c>

The contour of the field struck the Buddha’s imagination and he asked Ānanda to design a robe of the same pattern. Ānanda did this very successfully, and this pattern has been adopted for the robes of members of the Order ever since. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.287</c>

               <br/>A park near Rājagaha, at the foot of Gijjhakūṭa. It was a preserve where deer and game could dwell in safety. When Devadatta, wishing to kill the Buddha, hurled a rock down Gijjhakūṭa, it was stopped midway by another rock, but a splinter from it fell on the Buddha’s foot, wounding it severely. As the Buddha suffered much from loss of blood, the monks took him on a litter to Maddakucchi, and from there to the Jīvakambavana, where he was treated by Jīvaka. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.193f.</c>  It is said <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.27f.</c>  that seven hundred devas of the Satullapa group visited the Buddha there and told him of their great admiration for his qualities. Māra tried to stir up discontent in the Buddha, but had to retire discomfited. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.110</c>

The Buddha read his thoughts, appeared before him, and urged upon him the necessity of so doing. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.105</c> 
               <br/>Maddakucchi was difficult of access; monks who came from afar late at night, wishing to put Dabba Mallaputta’s powers to the test, would often ask him to provide lodging there for them. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.76</c>

               </b>
               <br/>The name of a people and their country.<br/>The country is included in the sixteen Great Nations of the Buddha’s time. The kingdom, at that time, was divided into two parts, having their respective capitals in Pāvā and Kusinārā. The Mallas of Pāvā were called Pāveyyakā Mallā, those of Kusināra, Kosinārakā. That these were separate kingdoms is shown by the fact that after the Buddha’s death at Kusināra, the Mallas of Pāvā sent messengers to claim their share of the Buddha’s relics. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.165</c>  Each had their Mote Hall.<br/>In the Saṅgīti Sutta we are told that the Buddha, in the course of one of his journeys, came with five hundred followers to Pāvā and stayed in the Ambavana of Cunda the smith. A new Mote Hall, called Ubbhataka, had just been completed for the Mallas of Pāvā, and the Buddha was invited to be the first to occupy it that it might be consecrated thereby. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and preached in the Hall far into the night. It was also at Pāvā that the Buddha took his last meal, of Sūkaramaddava, at the house of Cunda. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.126f.</c>  From there he went to Kusinārā, and there, as he lay dying, he sent Ānanda to the Mallas of Kusināra, who were assembled in their Mote Hall to announce his approaching death. The Mallas thereupon came to the Upavattana Sāla grove where the Buddha was, in order to pay him their last respects. Ānanda made them stand in groups according to family, and then presented them to the Buddha, announcing the name of each family. After the Buddha’s death, they met together once more in the Mote Hall, and made arrangements to pay him all the honour due to a Cakkavatti. They cremated the Buddha’s body at the Makuṭabandhana cetiya, and then collected the relics, which they deposited in their Mote Hall, surrounding them with a lattice work of spears and a rampart of bows till they were distributed among the various claimants by Doṇa. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.166</c>  The Mallas, both of Pāvā and Kusināra, erected thūpas over their respective shares of the relics and held feasts in their honour. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.167</c> 
               <br/>The Malla capital of Kusinārā was, in the Buddha’s day, a place of small importance. Ānanda contemptuously refers to it as a “little wattle and daub town in the midst of a jungle, a branch township,” quite unworthy of being the scene of the Buddha’s Parinibbāna. But the Buddha informs Ānanda that it was once Kusāvatī, the mighty capital of Kusa and Mahāsudassana. They were regarded, together with the Vajjis, as a typical example of a republic. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.231</c>  The chief Mallas administered the state in turn.<br/>Both the Buddha and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta appear to have had followers among the Mallas. Pāvā was the scene of Nāṭaputta’s death, just as Kusinārā was of the Buddha’s. Several followers of the Buddha among the Mallas are mentioned by name—e.g., Dabba, Pukkusa, Khaṇḍasumana, Bhadragaka, Rāsiya, Rojā and Sīha.<br/>Other places in the Malla country, besides Pāvā and Kusinārā, are mentioned where the Buddha stayed—e.g., Bhoganagara, Anupiya and Uruvelakappa, near which was the Mahāvana, a wide tract of forest.<br/>

               </b>
               <br/>Chief queen of Pasenadi, king of Kosala.<br/>Mallika’s knowledge of the Dhamma made her wiser than Pasenadi would have desired, and he once, in a moment of great affection, asked if anyone were dearer to her than her own “self.” “No, Sire,” was the answer; the king was evidently greatly disappointed, for he sought the Buddha, who explained to him that Mallikā, in making that answer, had uttered a great truth.<c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.75</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.v.1</c>  It is said <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.57</c>  that Pasenadi was on a visit to the Buddha when a man came with the whispered message that the queen was dead. It was a terrible shock, “his shoulders drooped, his mouth fell, and he sat brooding, unable to speak.”<br/>Mallikā had a daughter by Pasenadi; no mention is made of a son. Probably it is Vajirī, who is spoken of as the king’s only daughter. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.110</c>  He is said to have been disappointed on hearing that the child was a girl; but the Buddha assured him that women were sometimes wiser than men. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.86f.</c> 
               <br/>Only one instance is on record of Mallikā asking a question of the Buddha. She wished to know why some women are plain, others beautiful, some rich, and others poor. And the Buddha explained to her the reasons for these discrepancies.<br/>In the Piyajātika Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.106ff.</c>  Pasenadi is said to have taunted her because “her recluse Gotama” had said that dear ones bring sorrow and tribulation. “If the Lord says so, it must be so,” she replies; but secretly sends Nāḷijaṅgha to find out from the Buddha himself if he had said so and why. Having learnt the facts, she faces Pasenadi again, and convinced him too that the Buddha is right.<br/>Mallikā had a garden, called the Mallikārāma, in which was a Hall among the Deispyros trees set apart for religious discussions between members of various sects. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.22</c>

The Buddha appeared before him, telling him to go. He sent for him and asked him to teach the Doctrine to his associates. This Kappina did, and at the end of a single sermon one thousand listening recluses became arahants, hence the title conferred on him.<br/>The Theragāthā contains verses in which he celebrates wisdom and equanimity in theface of death. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.547–556</c> 
               <br/>Kappina is described by the Buddha as pale, thin, and having a prominent nose. It was owing to his psychic powers that he was able to follow the Buddha to the Brahma world. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.145</c>

                  <c c="#a00149">Mahākassapa</c>
               </b> Kassapa Pippali<br/>One of the Buddha’s most eminent disciples, chief among those who upheld austere practices. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.23</c>  His personal name was Pippali, but he is usually known by his clan name Kassapa, prefixed with Mahā to distinguish him from the other Kassapas.<br/>Mahākassapa went forth, apparently together with his wife Bhaddā Kāpilānī, before meeting the Buddha on the road. He gave him a brief teaching: <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.220</c>  ‘There shall be a lively sense of conscience and regard towards all monks, seniors, novices, and those of middle status.’ ‘Whatever doctrine I shall hear bearing upon what is good, to all that I will hearken with attentive ear, digesting it, pondering it, gathering it all up with my will.’ ‘Happy mindfulness with respect to the body shall not be neglected by me.’<br/>The Buddha exchanged his worn robes for Kassapa’s, which was regarded as a unique honor. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.221</c> 
               <br/>Kassapa was not present at the death of the Buddha; as he was journeying from Pāvā to Kusināra he met an Ājīvaka carrying in his hand a mandārava flower picked up by him from among those which had rained from heaven in honour of the Buddha, and it was he who told Kassapa the news. It was then the seventh day after the Buddha’s death, and the Mallas had been trying in vain to set fire to his pyre. The arahant theras, who were present, declared that it could not be kindled until Mahā Kassapa and his five hundred companions had saluted the Buddha’s feet. Mahā Kassapa then arrived and walked three times round the pyre with bared shoulder, and it is said the Buddha’s feet became visible from out of the pyre in order that he might worship them. He was followed by his five hundred colleagues, and when they had all worshipped the feet disappeared and the pyre kindled of itself. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.163f.</c> 
               <br/>At Pāvā (on the announcement of the Buddha’s death), Kassapa had heard the words of Subhadda, who, in his old age, had joined the Order, that they were “well rid of the great samaṇa and could now do as they liked.” This remark it was which had suggested to Kassapa’s mind the desirability of holding a Recital of the Buddha’s teachings. The five hundred who were selected met in Council under the presidency of Kassapa and recited the Dhamma and the Vinaya.<br/>The books contain numerous references to Mahā Kassapa—he is classed with Moggallāna, Kappina, and Anuruddha for his great iddhi-powers. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.114</c> 
               <br/>The Buddha regarded him as equal to himself in exhorting the monks to lead the active and zealous lives, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.205</c>  and constantly held him up as an example to others in his great contentment <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.194f.</c>  and his ability to win over families by his preaching. The Buddha compares him to the moon, unobtrusive; his heart was free from bondage, and he always taught others out of a feeling of compassion. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.197ff.</c>  The Buddha also thought him equal to himself in his power of attaining the jhānas and abiding therein. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.210ff.</c> 
               <br/>Kassapa was willing to help monks along their way, and several instances are given of his exhortations to them. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1051–1057</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1072–1081</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.161ff.</c>  But he would not address them unless he felt them to be tractable and deferential to instruction. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.203ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.219</c> 
               <br/>He was very reluctant to preach to the nuns, but on one occasion he allowed himself to be persuaded by Ānanda, and accompanied by him he visited the nunnery and preached to the nuns. He was probably not popular among certain nuns, for, at the end of his discourse, Thullatissā openly reviled him for what she called his impertinence in having dared to preach in the presence of Ānanda, “as if the needle pedlar were to sell a needle to the needle maker.”. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.215f.</c>  Kassapa was very careful of the good name of the Order, and we find him <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.218f.</c>  blaming Ānanda for admitting into the Order new members incapable of observing its discipline and of going about with them in large numbers, exposing the Order to the criticism of the public. “A corn trampler art thou, Ānanda,” he says, “a despoiler of families, thy following is breaking up, thy youngsters are melting away,” and ends up with “The boy, methinks, does not know his own measure.” Ānanda, annoyed at being called “boy,” protests “Surely my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence.” Ānanda regarded Kassapa in some sort of way as a teacher, and held him in great respect, not daring to mention even his name, lest it should imply disrespect. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.92f.</c> 
               <br/>Thullanandā heard Kassapa censuring Ānanda and raised her voice in protest, “What now? Does Kassapa, once a heretic, deem that he can chide the learned sage Ānanda?” Kassapa was hurt by her words, and complained to Ānanda that such things should be said of him who had been singled out by the Buddha for special honour.<br/>Kassapa viewed with concern the growing laxity among members of the Order with regard to the observance of rules, even in the very lifetime of the Buddha, and the falling off in the number of those attaining arahantship, and we find him consulting the Buddha as to what should be done. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.224f.</c>  At the First Council, when Ānanda stated that the Buddha had given leave for the monks to do away with the minor rules of the Order, Kassapa was opposed to any such step, lest it should lead to slackness among the monks and contempt from the laity. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.287f.</c> 
               <br/>Kassapa himself did his utmost to lead an exemplary life, dwelling in the forest, subsisting solely on alms, wearing rag robes, always content with little, holding himself aloof from society, ever strenuous and energetic. See also the Mahāgosiṅga Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.214</c>  where Kassapa declares his belief in the need for these observances; that his example was profitable to others is proved by the case of Somamitta who, finding his own teacher Vimala given up to laziness, sought Kassapa and attained arahantship under his guidance.<br/>When asked why he led such a life, he replied that it was not only for his own happiness but also out of compassion for those who came after him, that they might attain to the same end. Even when he was old and the Buddha himself had asked him to give up his coarse rag robe and to dwell near him, he begged to be excused. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.202f.</c> 
               <br/>Once, when Kassapa lay grievously ill at Pipphaliguhā, the Buddha visited him and reminded him of the seven bojjhangas which he had practised. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.78</c> 
               <br/>Kassapa had special compassion for the poor and would sgo to the poorest families to seek alms. <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.iii.7</c> 
               <br/> Sāriputta seems to have held Kassapa in great esteem, and the Kassapa Saṃyutta contains two discussions between them: one on the necessity for zeal and ardour in the attainment of Nibbāna, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.195f.</c>  and the other on the existence of a Tathāgata after death. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.222f.</c>  This regard was mutual, for when Kassapa saw the great honour paid to Sāriputta by the devas he rejoiced greatly and broke forth into song. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1082–1085</c>

               </b> Mahākotthita Koṭṭhita Kotthita<br/>One of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, ranked foremost among masters of analytical knowledge. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.24</c>  His Theragāthā verse speaks of contentment and shaking off evil qualities. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.2</c> 
               <br/>Several instances are given of discussions between Koṭṭhita and other eminent theras—e.g., the Naḷakalāpiya Sutta on kamma, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.112f.</c>  the Sīla Sutta on religious discipline, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.165ff.</c>  three suttas on the nature of arising, two on satisfaction, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.172–177</c>  two on arising, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.173</c>  and three on ignorance and knowledge. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.17</c>  Another similar sutta is on sense and sense objects, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.162–165</c>  and there is a series of suttas on matters not revealed by the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.384–391</c> 
               <br/>All these suttas took the form of discussions with Sāriputta, in which Mahā Koṭṭhita is the questioner and Sāriputta the instructor.<br/>One sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.145–147</c>  records a “lesson” given by the Buddha to Koṭṭhita on conceptions of impermanence, suffering and not-self. The Aṅguttara Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.118f.</c>  records a discussion at Jetavana between Savittha, Koṭṭhita and Sāriputta, as to who is best: one who has testified to the truth with body, one who has won view, or one released by faith. Another discussion <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.161f.</c>  takes place between Sāriputta and Koṭṭhita as to whether anything continues to exist after the ending of the six spheres of contact. Once there was a dispute between Koṭṭhita and Citta Hatthisāriputta; Citta was constantly interrupting the elder monks who were gathered at Isipatana for the discussion of the Abhidhamma, and was asked by Koṭṭhita to abide his time and not interrupt. Citta’s friends protested that Citta was well qualified to take part in the discussion; but Koṭṭhita declared that, far from being wise enough, Citta would, not long after, renounce the Order. And so it happened. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.392ff.</c> 
               <br/>Sāriputta evidently had a great regard for Koṭṭhita; the Theragāthā <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1006–1008</c>  contains three stanzas in which Sāriputta proclaims his excellence.<br/>

               </b> (1) <br/>A Sākiyan rājā, son of Amitodana; he was elder brother of Anuruddha and cousin of the Buddha. When the Sākiyan families of Kapilavatthu sent their representatives to join the Order of their distinguished kinsman, Mahānāma allowed Anuruddha to leave the household, he knowing nothing of household affairs. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.180f.</c> 
               <br/>Mahānāma showed great generosity to the Saṅgha, and was proclaimed best of those who gave choice alms to the monks. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.26</c>  Once, with the Buddha’s permission, he supplied the Order with medicaments for three periods of four months each. The Chabbaggiyā, always intent on mischief, tried in vain to discourage him. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.101</c>  At the end of the year, Mahānāma wished to continue the supply of good food to the Buddha and his monks, but the Buddha refused his permission.<br/>Mahānāma was a devoted follower of the Buddha and wished to understand the Doctrine. The books record several conversations between him and the Buddha, and Ānanda, Godha, and Lomasavaṅgīsa. Once when the Buddha arrived at Kapilavatthu he asked Mahānāma to find him lodging for the night. Mahānāma tried everywhere without success, and finally suggested that the Buddha should spend the night in the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu Kālāma. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.327f.</c>  This he did, and was joined there the next morning by Mahānāma; as a result of the discussion between the Buddha, Mahānāma and Bharaṇḍu, the last-named left Kapilavatthu never to return. On another occasion, Mahānāma visited the Buddha at Nigrodhārāma where the Buddha was convalescing after a severe illness, and at once Mahānāma asked a question as to whether concentration followed or preceded knowledge. Ānanda, who was present, not wishing the Buddha to be troubled, took Mahānāma aside and explained to him the Buddha’s teachings on the subject. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.219f.</c>

               </b> Gotamī Pajāpatī<br/>An eminent bhikkhunī and the step-mother of the Buddha. She raised the Buddha as her own child after the death of his mother.<br/>She is chiefly remembered as the first bhikkhunī. When the Buddha was staying at Kapilavatthu she approached the Buddha with 500 Sakyan ladies and asked leave to be ordained as nuns. The Buddha did not acquiesce, and he went on to Vesāli. But Pajāpatī and her companions cut off their hair, and donning yellow robes, followed the Buddha to Vesāli on foot. They arrived with sore feet at the Buddha’s monastery and repeated their request. The Buddha again refused, but Ānanda interceded on their behalf and Mahāpajāpatī’s ordination was granted on condition that she abide by eight rules of respect. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.253ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.274ff.</c> 
               <br/>After her ordination, Pajāpatī came to the Buddha and worshipped him. The Buddha preached to her and gave her a subject for meditation. With this topic she developed insight and soon after won arahantship, while her five hundred companions attained to the same after listening to the Nandakovāda Sutta. Later, at an assembly of monks and nuns in Jetavana, the Buddha declared Pajāpatī chief of those who were long ordained. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.25</c> 
               <br/>It is said that once Pajāpatī made a robe for the Buddha of wonderful material and marvellously elaborate. But when it came to be offered to the Buddha he refused it, and suggested it should be given to the Order as a whole. Pajāpatī was greatly disappointed, and Ānanda intervened. But the Buddha explained that his suggestion was for the greater good of Pajāpatī, and also as an example to those who might wish to make similar gifts in the future. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.iii.253ff.</c>  The Buddha had a great love for Pajāpatī, and when she lay ill, as there were no monks to visit her and preach to her the Buddha went himself to preach to her. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.56</c> 
               <br/>Her Therīgāthā verses speak of offering homage to the Buddha, and how she had been a relative of his in many past lives. She acknowledges Māyā, through whom the Buddha was born, and says that the correct way to worship the Buddha is but diligent practice. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thig.157–162</c>

He found Moggallāna and repeated the stanza he had heard from Assaji ye dhammā hetuppabhavā, etc., and Moggallāna also became a sotāpanna. The two then resolved to visit the Buddha at Veḷuvana, after an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Sañjaya to accompany them. Sañjaya’s disciples, however, five hundred in number, agreed to go, and they all arrived at Veḷuvana. The Buddha preached to them, and ordained them by saying, ”Come, monks.” <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.39ff.</c>  Moggallāna went to the hamlet of Kallavāla <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.85f.</c>  in Māgadha, and there, on the seventh day after his ordination, drowsiness overcame him as he sat meditating.

That very day he attained arahantship.<br/>Sāriputta and Moggallāna are declared to be the ideal disciples, whose example others should try to follow.<c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.235</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.88</c>  In the Saccavibhaṅga Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.iii.248</c>  the Buddha thus distinguishes these “twin brethren” from the others— “Sāriputta is as she who brings forth and Moggallāna is as the nurse of what is brought forth; Sāriputta trains in the fruits of conversion, Moggallāna trains in the highest good.” Moggallāna’s pre eminence lay in his possession of psychic power. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.23</c>  He could create a living shape innumerable times and could transfer himself into any shape at will. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1183</c>  When the Buddha and his monks failed to get alms in Verañja, Moggallāna offered to turn the earth upside down, so that the essence of the earth, which lay on the under surface, might serve as food. He also offered to open a way from Nalerupu, that the monks might easily go there for alms; but this offer was refused by the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.7</c> 
               <br/>Several instances are given of this special display of iddhi. Once, at the Buddha’s request, with his great toe he shook the Migāramātupāsāda, and made it rattle in order to terrify some monks who sat in the ground floor of the building, talking loosely and frivolously, regardless even of the fact that the Buddha was in the upper story. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.269ff.</c> 
               <br/>On another occasion, when Moggallāna visited Sakka to find out if he had profited by the Buddha’s teaching, he found him far too proud and obsessed by the thought of his own splendour. He thereupon shook Sakka’s palace, Vejayanta, till Sakka’s hair stood on end with fright and his pride was humbled. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.251ff.</c>  Again, Moggallāna is mentioned as visiting the Brahma world in order to help the Buddha in quelling the arrogance of Baka Brahmā. He himself questioned Baka in solemn conclave in the Sudhamma-Hall in the Brahma world and made him confess his conviction that his earlier views were erroneous. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1198</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.144f.</c>  Other visits of his to the Brahma world are also recorded when he held converse with Tissa Brahmā. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.331ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.75ff.</c> 
               <br/>In the Māratajjanīya Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.332ff.</c>  we are told how Māra worried Moggallāna by entering into his belly, but Moggallāna ordered him out and told him how he himself had once been a Māra named Dūsī whose sister Kāḷī was the mother of the present Māra. Dūsī incited the householders against Kakusandha Buddha and was, as a result, born in purgatory.<br/>Moggallāna could see petas and other spirits invisible to the ordinary mortal eye. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.254ff.</c>  We are told <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.366f.</c>  that Moggallāna’s visits to the deva worlds were very welcome to the devas.<br/>The Buddha paid a compliment to Moggallāna’s powers of preaching, when, having preached himself to the Sākyans in their new Mote Hall at Kapilavatthu, he asked Moggallāna, after their departure, to talk to the monks, as he himself was weary. And Moggallāna spoke to them of lusts and of the means of getting rid of them. At the end of the sermon the Buddha praised him warmly. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.183ff.</c>  Mention is made elsewhere <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.262–269</c>  of eloquent sermons preached by him on the jhānas, on qualities which lead to true emancipation, <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.155ff.</c>  and of visits paid to him by Sakka in company with numerous other gods in order to hear him preach. Other devas also went to hear him—e.g., Candana, Suyāma, Santusita, Sunimitta and Vasavatti <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.269–280</c>  He was also consulted by those, such as Vacchagotta, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.391ff.</c>  and Vappa, <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.196ff.</c>  eager to learn from him the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha placed great faith in his two chief disciples and looked to them to keep the Order pure. There is one instance recorded of Moggallāna seizing a wicked monk, thrusting outside and bolting the door. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.204ff.</c>  Once, when a monk charged Sāriputta with having offended him as he was about to start on a journey, Moggallāna and Ānanda went from lodging to lodging to summon the monks that they might hear Sāriputta vindicate himself. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.236</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.374</c> 
               <br/>Their fame had reached even to the Brahma world, for we find Tudu Brahmā singing their praises, much to the annoyance of the Kokālika monk.<c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.170ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.p.231ff.</c>  When Devadatta created a schism among the monks and took five hundred of them to Gayāsīsa, the Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to bring them back. They were successful in this mission. Kakudha Koliyaputta, once servant of Moggallāna and later born in a huge manomayakāya, had warned Moggallāna of Devadatta’s intrigues against the Buddha, but the Buddha ignored this information carried to him by Moggallāna.<c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.185</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.122ff.</c>  Moggallāna seems to have carried out diligently the charge laid on him by the Buddha of looking after the monks’ welfare. Among the verses attributed to him in the Theragāthā are several containing exhortations to his colleagues. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1146–1149</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1165f.</c>  Some of the colleagues are mentioned by name—e.g., Tissa, Vaḍḍhamāna and Potthila.<c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1162</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1163</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1174f.</c>  Elsewhere <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.194f.</c>  mention is made of his living at Kāḷasilā, with a company of five hundred monks, watching over them and discovering that all were arahants. Vaṅgīsa witnessed this and praised Moggallāna in verse before the Buddha.<br/>The love existing between Moggallāna and Sāriputta was mutual, as was the admiration. Sāriputta’s verses in praise of Moggallāna <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1178–1181</c>  are even more eloquent than those of Moggallāna in praise of Sāriputta. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1176</c>  Their strongest bond was the love of each for the Buddha; when away from him, they would relate to each other how they had been conversing with him by means of the divine ear and the divine eye. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.275ff.</c>  Moggallāna elsewhere also <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.273f.</c>  tells the monks of a conversation he held with the Buddha by means of these divine powers. For another discussion between Sāriputta and Moggallāna, see. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.154f.</c> 
               <br/>In the Mahāgosiṅga Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.212</c>  we find them staying in the Gosiṅgasālavana in the company of Mahā Kassapa, Ānanda, Revata and Anuruddha, engaged in friendly discussion, referring their conclusions to the Buddha for his opinion. Sāriputta, Moggallāna, and Anuruddha are again mentioned <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.174f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.299</c>  as staying in the Ketakīvana in Sāketa. Among discussions between Anuruddha and Moggallāna is recorded one in which Anuruddha speaks of the value of cultivating the four satipaṭṭhānas. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.294f.</c>  It seems to have been usual for Sāriputta and Moggallāna, in their journeys, to travel together at the head of the monks, and lay disciples, who gave alms to the monks, were anxious to include them in their invitations. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.336</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.63</c> 
               <br/>Sāriputta dies before Moggallāna. The Theragāthā contains several verses attributed to Moggallāna regarding Sāriputta’s death. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.1158–1161</c>  Moggallāna evidently dies before the Buddha, as the Saṃyutta contains a reference to the Buddha speaking of them both as dead. However the early texts contain no record of the circumstances of Moggallāna’s death.<br/>

               <br/>One of the four chief kingdoms of India at the time of the Buddha, the others being Kosala, the kingdom of the Vaṃsas and Avanti. Māgadha formed one of the sixteen Mahājanapadas and had its capital at Rājagaha or Giribbaja where Bimbisāra, and after him Ajātasattu, reigned. Later, Pāṭaliputta became the capital. By the time of Bimbisāra, Aṅga, too, formed a part of Māgadha, and he was known as king of Aṅga Māgadha. Thus Bimbisāra sends for Soṇa Koḷivisa, a prominent citizen of Campā, capital of Aṅga. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.27</c>  In the Buddha’s day, Māgadha consisted of eighty thousand villages. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.179</c> 
               <br/>Ajātasattu succeeded in annexing Kosala with the help of the Licchavis, and he succeeded also in bringing the confederation of the latter under his sway; preliminaries to this struggle are mentioned in the books. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.73f.</c>

The latter river formed the boundary between Māgadha and the republican country of the Licchavis, and both the Māgadhas and the Licchavis evidently had equal rights over the river.<br/>During the early Buddhist period Māgadha was an important political and commercial centre, and was visited by people from all parts of Northern India in search of commerce and of learning. The kings of Māgadha maintained friendly relations with their neighbours, Bimbisāra and Pasenadi marrying each other’s sisters. When Candappajjota of Ujjeni was suffering from jaundice, Bimbisāra sent him his own personal physician, Jīvaka.<br/>In Māgadha was the real birth of Buddhism (see, e.g., the words put in the mouth of Sahampati: pātur ahosi Magadhesu pubbe dhammo <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.5</c>  ), and it was from Māgadha that it spread after the Third Council. The Buddha’s chief disciples, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, came from Māgadha. The cornfields of Māgadha were rich and fertile. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.208</c> 
               <br/>The names of several places in Māgadha occur in the books—e.g., Ekanālā, NāIakagāma, Senānigama, Khāṇumata, Andhakavindha, Macala, Matula, Ambalaṭṭhikā, Pāṭaligāma, NāIandā and SāIindiya.<br/>Māgadha is identified with the modern South Behar.<br/>

               <br/>The legends concerning Māra are, in the books, very involved and defy any attempts at unravelling them.<br/>Māra is frequently used in a symbolic sense to refer to the whole of the worldly existence, the five khandhas, or the realm of rebirth, as opposed to Nibbāna. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.195</c>

               <br/>In view of the many studies of Māra by various scholars, already existing, it might be worth while here, too, to attempt a theory of Māra in Buddhism, based chiefly on the above data. The commonest use of the word was evidently in the sense of Death. From this it was extended to mean “the world under the sway of death” <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.228</c>  and the beings therein. Thence, the kilesas also came to be called Māra in that they were instruments of Death, the causes enabling Death to hold sway over the world. All Temptations brought about by the kilesas were likewise regarded as the work of Death. There was also evidently a legend of a devaputta of the Vasavatti world, called Māra, who considered himself the head of the Kāmāvacara world and who recognized any attempt to curb the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, as a direct challenge to himself and to his authority. As time went on these different conceptions of the word became confused one with the other, but this confusion is not always difficult to unravel.<br/>Various statements are found in the Pitakas connected with Māra, which have, obviously, reference to Death, the kilesas, and the world over which Death and the kilesas hold sway. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.91</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.73</c>

               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.135</c> 
               <br/>The legend of Māra attacking the Buddha to prevent his Awakening had its origin in the Padhāna Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.494–517</c>  There Māra is represented as visiting Gotama on the banks of the Nerañjara, where he is practicing austerities and tempting him to abandon his striving and devote himself to good works. Gotama refers to Māra’s army as being tenfold. The divisions are as follows: the first consists of the Lusts; the second is Aversion; the third Hunger and Thirst; the fourth Craving; the fifth Sloth and Indolence; the sixth Cowardice; the seventh Doubt; the eighth Hypocrisy and Stupidity; Gains, Fame, Honour and Glory falsely obtained form the ninth; and the tenth is the Lauding of oneself and the Contemning of others. “Seeing this army on all sides,” says the Buddha, “I go forth to meet Māra with his equipage. He shall not make me yield ground. That army of thine, which the world of devas and men conquers not, even that, with my wisdom, will I smite, as an unbaked earthen bowl with a stone.” Here we have practically all the elements found in the later elaborated versions.<br/>The second part of the Padhāna Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.446f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.122</c>  is obviously concerned with later events in the life of Gotama. After Māra had retired discomfited, he followed the Buddha for seven years, watching for any transgression on his part. But the quest was in vain, and, “like a crow attacking a rock,” he left Gotama in disgust. “The lute of Māra, who was so overcome with grief, slipped from his arm. Then, in dejection, the Yakkha disappeared thence.”<br/>The Saṃyutta Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.124f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.46</c>  also contains a sutta in which three daughters of Māra are represented as tempting the Buddha after his Enlightenment. Their names are Taṇhā, Arati and Ragā, and they are evidently personifications of three of the ten forces in Māra’s army, as given in the Padhāna Sutta. They assume numerous forms of varying age and charm, full of blandishment, but their attempt is vain, and they are obliged to admit defeat.<br/>Once Māra came to be regarded as the Spirit of Evil all temptations of lust, fear, greed, etc., were regarded as his activities, and Māra was represented as assuming various disguises in order to carry out his nefarious plans. Thus the books mention various occasions on which Māra appeared before the Buddha himself and his disciples, men and women, to lure them away from their chosen path.<br/>Soon after the Buddha’s first vassa, Māra approached him and asked him not to teach the monks regarding the highest emancipation, he himself being yet bound by Māra’s fetters. But the Buddha replied that he was free of all fetters, human and divine. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.22</c>  On another occasion Māra entered into the body of Vetambarī and made him utter heretical doctrines. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.67</c>  In the Brahmanimantanika Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.326</c>  Māra is spoken of as entering the hearts even of the inhabitants of the Brahma world. The Māra Saṃyutta <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.103ff.</c>  contains several instances of Māra’s temptations of the Buddha by assailing him with doubts as to his emancipation, feelings of fear and dread, appearing before him in the shape of an elephant, a cobra, in various guises beautiful and ugly, making the rocks of Gijjhakūṭa fall with a crash; by making him wonder whether he should ever sleep; by suggesting that, as human life was long, there was no need for haste in living the good life; by dulling the intelligence of his hearers. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.58</c>  In the account of Godhika’s suicide <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.122</c>  there is a curious statement that, after Godhika died, Māra went about looking for his consciousness, and the Buddha pointed him out to the monks, “going about like a cloud of smoke.”<br/>The books mention many occasions on which Māra assumed various forms under which to tempt bhikkhunīs, often in lonely spots—e.g., Āḷavikā, Kisāgotamī, Somā, Vijayā, Uppalavantnā, Cālā, Upacālā, Sisūpacālā, Selā, Vajirā and Khemā.<br/>Mention is made, especially in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta, of several occasions on which Māra approached the Buddha, requesting him to die; the first of these occasions was under the Ajapala Banyan tree at Uruvelā, soon after the Enlightenment, but the Buddha refused to die until the sāsana was firmly established.<br/>With the accounts of Māra, as the personification of Evil, came to be mixed legends of an actual devaputta, named Māra, also called Vasavatti, because he was an inhabitant of the Paranimmitā Vasavatti deva world. In the Aṅguttara Nikāya, Māra is described as the head of those enjoying bliss in the Kāmāvacara worlds. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.17</c>  In the Māratajjanīya Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.333</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.79</c>  Moggallāna says that he too had once been a Māra, Dūsī by name; Kālā was his sister’s name, and the Māra of the present age was his nephew. In the sutta, Dūsī is spoken of as having been responsible for many acts of mischief, similar to those ascribed to the Māra of Gotama’s day. According to the sutta, Māradevaputta was evidently regarded as a being of great power, with a strong bent for mischief, especially directed against holy men.<br/>

               </b> Migaladdhika<br/>An undesirable monk. When the Buddha had once been preaching to the monks in Mahāvana in Vesāli regarding the defilement and filth of the body, and had retired into solitude, many of the monks, in disgust with their bodies, put an end to their lives. Some of them sought out Migalandika and asked him to cut off their heads. This he did with a sword, but on his way to the River Vaggamudā, to wash his sword, he was seized with remorse. A Mārakāyika devatā, however, appeared before him in the river and assured him he was doing a service to the monks by helping them to commit suicide. This encouraged him, and he put to death many more monks, until the Buddha, discovering the facts, intervened. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.68ff.</c>

               <br/>The name given to the monastery erected by Visākhā Migāramātā in the Pubbārāma, to the east of Sāvatthī. It is said that, one day, when Visākhā had gone to the monastery to hear the Dhamma and afterwards attend on the sick monks and novices, she left in the preaching hall her jewellery and her servant girl forgot to remove it. Later, on going to fetch it, she found that Ānanda had put it away, and Visākhā, being told of this, decided not to wear it again. She had it valued by goldsmiths, who declared that it was worth nine crores and one hundred thousand. She had the ornament put in a cart and sent round for sāle. But there was none in Sāvatthī rich enough to buy it, and Visākhā herself bought it back. With the money thus obtained she built the Migāramātupāsāda at the Buddha’s suggestion. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.161f.</c>  Moggallāna was left to supervise the work with five hundred other monks. Moggallāna made use of his iddhi powers in order to expedite and facilitate the work.<br/>Numerous suttas were preached there; chief among these were the Aggañña, the Uṭṭhāna, the Ariyapariyesanā, and the Pāsādakampana. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.77</c>

               </b>
               <br/>A group of monks, followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka forming part of the Chabbaggiyā (Group of Six Monks).<br/>Twice they brought an unfounded charge of breach of morality against Dabba Mallaputta, who seems to have earned their special dislike. Dabba was in charge of the distribution of alms at the ārāma where they stayed, and one day it was their turn to receive alms from a certain householder who had a reputation for providing good food. When, however, the man heard from Dabba that it was the turn of the Mettiyabhummajakā to receive his hospitality, he was much displeased, and ordered his female slave to look after them. The monks were greatly annoyed, and accused Dabba of having slandered them to the householder. They, therefore, persuaded a nun named Mettiyā to go to the Buddha and accuse Dabba of having violated her chastity. The charge was investigated and proved false and the nun expelled from the Order. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.76ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.160ff.</c> 
               <br/>On another occasion, these monks persuaded a Licchavi, named Vaḍḍha, who was their patron and friend, to go to the Buddha and charge Dabba with having had relations with his wife. This, too, was proved false, and other monks refused to accept alms from Vaḍḍha until he had confessed his guilt. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.124ff.</c>  One day, while descending from Gijjhakūṭa, the Mettiyabhummajakā monks saw a heifer with a she goat and the idea occurred to them of calling the heifer Dabba and the she goat Mettiyā and then of spreading the story that they had seen Dabba mating with Mettiyā. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.166ff.</c>

                  <c c="#a00149">Yakkha</c>
               </b>
               <br/>A class of non human beings generally described as non-human. They are mentioned with Devas, Rakkhasas, Dānavas, Gandhabbas, Kinnaras, and Mahoragas (? Nāgas).<br/>Elsewhere <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.38</c>  they rank, in progressive order, between manussā and gandhabbā. They are of many different kinds: spirits, ogres, dryads, ghosts, spooks. In the early records, yakkha, like nāga, as an appellative, was anything but depreciative. Thus not only is Sakka, king of the gods, so referred to, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.252</c>  but even the Buddha is spoken of as a yakkha in poetic diction. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.386</c>  Many gods, such as Kakudha, are so addressed. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.54</c>  Of these above named, the followers of Vessavaṇa appear to be the Yakkhas proper. The term yakkha as applied to purisa is evidently used in an exceptionally philosophical sense as meaning “soul” in such passages as ettāvatā yakkhassa suddhi, <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.478</c>  or ettāvat’ aggam no vadanti h’ ekā, yakkhassa suddhim idha paṇḍitāse. <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.875</c> 
               <br/>The cult of yakkhas seems to have arisen primarily from the woods and secondarily from the legends of sea faring merchants. To the latter origin belong the stories connected with vimānas found in or near the sea or in lakes. Generally speaking, the Yakkhas were decadent divinities, beings half deified, having a deva’s supernormal powers, particularly as regards influencing people, partly helpful, partly harmful. They are sometimes called devatā <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.205</c>  or devaputta. Some of these, like Indakūta and Sūciloma, are capable of intelligent questioning on metaphysics and ethics. All of them possess supernatural powers; they can transfer themselves at will, to any place, with their abodes, and work miracles, such as assuming any shape at will.<br/>Sometimes the Yakkhas have been degraded to the state of red eyed cannibal ogres. The female Yakkhas (Yakkhinī) are, in these cases, more fearful and evil minded than the male. They eat flesh and blood and devour even men. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.346</c> 
               <br/>Ordinarily the attitude of the Yakkhas towards man is one of benevolence. They are interested in the spiritual welfare of the human beings with whom they come in contact and somewhat resemble tutelary genii. In the Āṭānāṭiya Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.194f.</c>  however, the Yakkha king, Vessavaṇa, is represented as telling the Buddha that, for the most part, the Yakkhas believe neither in the Buddha nor in his teachings, which enjoin upon his followers abstention from various evils and are therefore distasteful to some of the Yakkhas. Such Yakkhas are disposed to molest the followers of the Buddha in their woodland haunts. Cp. the story of the Yakkha who wished to kill Sāriputta. <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.iv.4</c>  But the Mahā Yakkhas, <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.204f.</c>  the generals and commanders among Yakkhas, are always willing to help holy men and to prevent wicked Yakkhas from hurting them. Among Yakkhas are some beings who are sotāpannas—e.g., Janavasabha, Sūciloma and Khara. The case of the Yakkha Vajirapāṇi is of special interest. D.i.95 He is represented as a kind of mentor, hovering in the air, threatening to kill Ambaṭṭha, if he does not answer the Buddha’s question the third time he is asked. In many cases the Yakkhas are “fallen angels” and come eagerly to listen to the word of the Buddha in order to be able to rise to a higher sphere of existence e.g., Piyaṅkaramātā and Punabbasumātā, and even Vessavaṇa, listening to Veḷukaṇḍakī Nandamātā reciting the Parāyana Vagga. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.63</c>  At the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta many hundreds of thousands of Yakkhas were present among the audience.<br/>The names of the Yakkhas often give us a clue to their origin and function. These are taken from (a) their bodily appearance e.g., Kuvannā, Khara, Kharaloma, Kharadāthika, Citta, Cittarāja, Silesaloma, Sūciloma and Hāritā; (b) their place of residence, attributes of their realms, animals, plants, etc. e.g., Ajakalāpaka, Āḷavaka (forest dweller), Uppala, Kakudha (name of plant), Kumbhīra, Gumbiya, Disāmukha, Yamamoli, Vajira, Vajirapāṇi or Vajirabāhu, Sātāgira, Serīsaka; (c) qualities of character, etc. e.g., Adhamma, Katattha, Dhamma, Puṇṇaka, Māra, Sakaṭa; (d) embodiments of former persons e.g., Janavasabha (lord of men= Bimbisāra), Dīgha, Naradeva, Paṇḍaka, Sīvaka, Serī.<br/>Vessavaṇa is often mentioned as king of the Yakkhas. He is one of the four Regent Gods, and the Āṭānāṭiya Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.199ff.</c>  contains a vivid description of the Yakkha kingdom of Uttarakuru, with its numerous cities, crowds of inhabitants, parks, lakes and assembly halls. Vessavaṇa is also called Kuvera, and the Yakkhas are his servants and messengers.

               </b> (1) <br/>He was the son of a very wealthy treasurer of Benares, and was brought up in great luxury, living in three mansions, according to the seasons and surrounded with all kinds of pleasures. Impelled by antecedent conditions, he saw one night the indecorum of his sleeping attendants, and, greatly distressed, put on his gold slippers and left the house and the town, non humans opening the gates for him. He took the direction of Isipatana, exclaiming— “Alas! What distress! Alas! What danger!” The Buddha saw him in the distance and called to him, “Come Yasa, here is neither distress nor danger.” Filled with joy, Yasa took off his slippers and sat beside the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him a graduated discourse, and when he had finished teaching the Truths, Yasa attained realization of the Dhamma. To Yasa’s father, too, who had come in search of his son, the Buddha preached the Doctrine, having first made Yasa invisible to him. At the end of the sermon he acknowledged himself the Buddha’s follower, and Yasa, who had been listening, became an arahant. When, therefore, Yasa’s presence became known to his father, who asked him to return to his grieving mother, the Buddha declared that household life had no attractions for Yasa and granted his request to be admitted to the Order. The next day, at the invitation of Yasa’s father, he went, accompanied by Yasa, to his house, and there, at the conclusion of the meal, he preached to Yasa’s mother and other members of the household, who all became his followers, thus becoming the first tevācikā upāsikā. When Yasa’s intimate friends, Vimala, Subāhu, Punnaji and Gavampati, heard of Yasa’s ordination they followed his example and joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course, as did fifty others of Yasa’s former friends and acquaintances. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.15–20</c> 
               <br/>A verse attributed to him in the Theragāthā says that he attained the Three Knowledges even while still adorned with fine clothes. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.117</c>

               </b> (2)  Kākandakaputta<br/>A monk who lived about a century after the Buddha, and who was one of the leaders in the events of the Second Council. When he arrived at the Kūṭāgārasālā in the Mahāvana, he discovered that the Vajjian monks had raised the “Ten Points” contrary to the Buddha’s teachings, and that they were publicly asking for money from their lay disciples. Yasa thereupon protested against such misdemeanours, and the Vajjian monks, hoping to win him over, offered him a share of the money they had collected.<br/>This offer he rejected with scorn, and the monks passed on him the Patisārattiyakamma (craving of pardon from lay folk). This necessitated that Yasa should be sent among the laymen, accompanied by a messenger, presumably to ask their pardon for having misinformed them. But instead of this, Yasa told the lay people that the behaviour of the Vajjian monks was completely at variance with the rules laid down by the Buddha, and quoted the Buddha’s discourses to prove his charge.<br/>When the Vajjian monks heard of this, they pronounced on him the Ukkhepaniyakamma (Act of Suspension), but when they assembled to carry it out, Yasa disappeared through the air to Kosambī, from where he sent messengers to the monks of Avanti, of the west (Pātheyyakā or Pāveyyakā) and of the south (Dakkhiṇāpatha), asking for their assistance in checking the corruption of the religion. With them he visited Sambhūta Sānavāsī at Ahogangapabbata, and there they decided to consult Revata who lived in Soreyya. Yasa, therefore, went to Revata, following him through Saṅkassa, Kaṇṇakujja, Udumbara, Aggalapura and Sahajāti. Having found Revata, he questioned him regarding the ten points, and obtained from him promise of assistance.<br/>Together they returned to Vesāli, where lived Sabbakāmī, the oldest Thera of the day. After obtaining his opinion on the matter, an assembly of the monks was held and a committee was appointed of four from the East: Sabbakāmī, Sāḷha, Khujjasobhita, and Vāsabhagāmika; and four from the West: Revata, Sambhūta-Sānavāsī, Yasa and Sumana. They debated the question at the Vālikārāma, Revata acting as questioner and Sabbakāmī answering his questions. At the end of the enquiry the decision was given against the ten points of the Vajjian monks, and this decision was conveyed to the assembly. Then the recital of the Vinaya was held in which seven hundred monks participated; this recital was called the Sattasatī. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.294ff.</c>

There they stood talking to the monks who lived there and made a great uproar. The Buddha, sending Ānanda to fetch them, asked them to remove themselves from his presence, as they were behaving like fishermen. Taking his admonition to heart, they returned to the banks of the Vaggumuṇḍā in the Vajji country, and there they determined to lead such lives as would commend them to the Buddha. During the rainy season, they all put forth effort and attained arahantship. Some time after, the Buddha visited Vesāli during a journey and asked Ānanda to send for Yasoja and his friends as he desired to see them. Ānanda sent a message. When the monks arrived, they found the Buddha lost in meditation, and they, too, seated themselves and entered into samādhi, remaining thus throughout the night. Āmaṇḍa could not understand why the Buddha, having sent for Yasoja and his companions, should have sunk into samādhi without greeting them, and three times during the night he tried to remind the Buddha of their arrival; but the Buddha ignored his warnings and in the morning explained to him that it was more joy for them all to live in the bliss of samādhi than to indulge in mere conversation.<br/>His Theragāthā verses speak in praise of a thin monk who is dedicated and content, while criticizing those who live in company. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.243–245</c> 
               <br/>The Vinaya relates <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.239</c>  how once, when Yasoja was ill, drugs were brought for his use, but as the Buddha had forbidden the use of a special place for storing such things they were left out of doors and were partly eaten by vermin, the remainder being carried away by robbers. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he allowed the use of a duly chosen storage place.<br/>

               <br/>Chief of those who had left the world through faith. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.24</c>  He was born at Thullakoṭṭhita in the Kuru country as the son of a very wealthy councillor and was called by his family name of Raṭṭhapāla. When the Buddha visited Thullakoṭṭhita, Raṭṭhapāla went to hear him preach and decided to leave the world. His parents would not, however, give their consent till he threatened to starve himself to death. Realizing then that he was in earnest, they agreed to let him go on condition that he would visit them after his ordination. Raṭṭhapāla accompanied the Buddha to Sāvatthī, and there, dwelling alone, he attained arahantship within a short time. Then, with the Buddha’s permission, he returned to Thullakoṭṭhita and dwelt in the deer park of the Kuru king. The day after his arrival, while begging for alms, he came to his father’s house. His father was in the entrance hall having his hair combed, but, failing to recognize his son, he started to abuse him, taking him for an ordinary monk, one of those who had robbed him of his son. Just at that moment the slave girl of the house was about to throw away some stale rice, which Raṭṭhapāla begged of her. The girl recognized his voice, gave him the rice and told his parents who he was. When his father came to look for his son, he found him eating stale rice. Having already finished eating, when invited to enter the house, he would not do so, but on the next day he went again, and his father tried to tempt him by making a display of the immense wealth which would be his should he return to the lay life, while his former wives, beautifully clothed, asked him about the nymphs, for whose sake he led the homeless life. “For the sake of no nymphs, Sisters,” he said, and they fell fainting under the shock of being addressed as “Sisters.” Growing impatient at the conduct of his family, he asked for his meal, ate it, preached to them. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.64f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.769–775</c>  on the impermanence of all things, the futility of wealth, the snare of beauty, etc., and returned to Migacīra.<br/>There the Kuru king, who was feasting there, and had often heard of Raṭṭhapāla’s fame, visited him. Their conversation is recorded in the Raṭṭhapāla Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.54ff.</c> 
               <br/>The Vinaya <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.148</c>  contains a stanza quoted by the Buddha, in which Raṭṭhapāla’s father enquires of his son why the latter never asked him for anything. “Because begging is a degrading thing,” says Raṭṭhapāla.<br/>

               </b>
               <br/>A city, the capital of Māgadha.<br/>The place was called Giribbaja (mountain stronghold) because it was surrounded by five hills—Paṇḍava, Gijjhakūṭa, Vebhāra, Isigili and Vepulla. It is said <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.iii.68</c>  that these hills, with the exception of Isigili, were once known by other names e.g., Vaṅkaka for Vepulla. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.191</c>  The Saṃyutta <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.206</c>  mentions another peak near Rājagaha—Indakūta.<br/>Rājagaha was closely associated with the Buddha’s work. He visited it soon after the Renunciation. Bimbisāra saw him begging in the street, and questioned him as to his purpose. <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.472–491</c>  During the first year after the Enlightenment the Buddha went to Rājagaha from Gayā, after the conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilas. Bimbisāra and his subjects gave the Buddha a great welcome, and the king entertained him and a large following of monks in the palace. It is said that on the day of the Buddha’s entry into the royal quarters, Sakka led the procession, in the guise of a young man, singing songs of praise of the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.35ff.</c>  Large numbers of householders joined the Order, and people blamed the Buddha for breaking up their families. But their censure lasted for only seven days. Among those ordained were the Sattarasavaggiyā with Upāli at their head.<br/>The Buddha spent his first vassa in Rājagaha and remained there during the winter and the following summer. The people grew tired of seeing the monks everywhere, and, on coming to know of their displeasure, the Buddha went first to Dakkhiṇāgiri and then to Kapilavatthu. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.77ff.</c> 
               <br/>Later the Buddha made Sāvatthī his headquarters, though he seems frequently to have visited and stayed at Rājagaha. It thus became the scene of several important suttas—e.g., the Āṭānāṭiya, Udumbarika and Kassapasīhanāda, Jīvaka, Mahāsakuladāyī, and Sakkapañha.<br/>Many of the Vinaya rules were enacted at Rājagaha. Just before his death, the Buddha paid a last visit there. At that time, Ajātasattu was contemplating an attack on the Vajjians, and sent his minister, Vassakāra, to the Buddha at Gijjhakūṭa, to find out what his chances of success were. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.72</c> 
               <br/>After the Buddha’s death, Rājagaha was chosen by the monks, with Mahā Kassapa at their head, as the meeting place of the First Convocation. This took place at the Sattapaṇṇiguhā, and Ajātasattu extended to the undertaking his whole hearted patronage. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.285</c>  The king also erected at Rājagaha a cairn over the relics of the Buddha, which he had obtained as his share. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.166</c> 
               <br/>Rājagaha was one of the six chief cities of the Buddha’s time, and as such, various important trade routes passed through it. The others cities were Campā, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī and Benares. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.147</c> 
               <br/>The Parāyana Vagga <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.1011–1013</c>  mentions a long and circuitous route, taken by Bāvarī’s disciples in going from Patiṭṭhāna to Rājagaha, passing through Māhissati, Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa. Vanasavhaya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, on to Rājagaha, by way of the usual places. The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.72ff.</c>  gives a list of the places at which the Buddha stopped during his last journey along that road—Ambalaṭṭhikā, Nāḷandā, Pāṭaligāma, Koṭigāma, Nādikā, Vesāli, Bhaṇḍagāma, Hatthigāma, Ambagāma, Jambugāma, Bhoganagara, Pāvā, and the Kakuttha River, beyond which lay the Mango grove and the Sāla grove of the Mallas.<br/>The books mention various places besides Veḷuvana, with its Kalandaka-nivāpa vihāra in and around Rājagaha—e.g., Sītavana, Jīvaka’s Ambavana, Pipphaliguhā, Udumbarikārāma, Moranivāpa with its Paribbājakārāma, Tapodārāma, Indasālaguhā in Vediyagiri, Sattapaṇṇiguhā, Latthivana, Maddakucchi, Supatiṭṭhacetiya, Pāsānakacetiya, Sappasoṇḍikapabbhāra and the pond Sumāgadhā.<br/>The city gates were closed every evening, and after that it was impossible to enter the city. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.116f.</c> 
               <br/>Ajātasattu was afraid of invasion by the Licchavis, and Vassakāra is mentioned as having strengthened its fortifications. To the north east of the city was the brahmin village of Ambasaṇḍā <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.263</c>  ; other villages are mentioned in the neighborhood, such as Kīṭāgiri, Upatissagāma, Kolitagāma, Andhakavinda, Sakkhara and Codanāvatthu.<br/>

The Buddha then instructed Rāhu to let them free. Rāhu immediately let them go and ran to Vepacitti, “trembling and with stiffened hair.” This incident evidently refers to the Indian myth of the eclipses, and the legend has been annexed by the Buddhists to illustrate the Buddha’s power and pity.<br/>Elsewhere. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.17</c>  Rāhu is spoken of as the chief of those possessing a large body.<br/>The seizure of the Moon by Rāhu and the escape from him is often used as a simile. <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.465</c>  Rāhu is one of the four “stains” of the Sun and the Moon, preventing them from shining in all their glory.<c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.53</c>

When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu for the first time after his Enlightenment and accepted Suddhodana’s invitation, Rāhula’s mother sent the boy to the Buddha to ask for his inheritance. The Buddha gave him no answer, and, at the conclusion of the meal, left the palace. Rāhula followed him, reiterating his request until at last the Buddha asked Sāriputta to ordain him. When Suddhodana heard of this he protested to the Buddha, and asked as a boon that, in future, no child should be ordained without the consent of his parents, and to this the Buddha agreed. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.82f.</c> 
               <br/>When Rāhula was seven years old, the Buddha preached to him the Ambalaṭṭhikā Rāhulovāda Sutta as a warning that he should never lie, even in fun. Rāhula used to accompany the Buddha on his begging rounds.<br/>Rāhula noticed that he harboured carnal thoughts fascinated by his own physical beauty and that of his father, the Buddha preached to him, at the age of eighteen, the Mahā Rāhulovāda Sutta. Two other suttas, also called Rāhulovāda, one included in the Saṃyutta and the other in the Aṅguttara, formed the topics for Rāhula’s meditation.<br/>Later, the Buddha, knowing that Rāhula’s mind was ripe for final attainment, went with him alone to Andhavana, and preached to him the Cūḷa Rāhulovāda Sutta. At the end of the discourse, Rāhula became an arahant, together with one hundred thousand crores of listening devas.<br/>The Buddha declared Rāhula foremost among those of his disciples who were anxious for training. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.24</c>  The Vinaya <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.16</c>  gives a story illustrating Rāhula’s extreme conscientiousness in the observance of rules. He arrived one evening at Kosambī, when the Buddha was staying there in the Badarikārāma. Rāhula was told there of a new rule which had been laid down to the effect that no novice should sleep under the same roof as a fully ordained monk. Unable to find any resting place which did not violate this rule, Rāhula spent the night in the Buddha’s bathroom. When the Buddha discovered him there the next morning, he modified the rule.<br/>Four verses uttered by Rāhula are included in the Theragāthā, where he says he s twice blessed to be an arahant and the Buddha’s son. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.295–298</c>

There the monks met him and consulted him regarding the “Ten Points.<br/>He enquired into these, and, after condemning them as wrong, decided to end the dispute. The Vajjiputtakas, too, had tried to win Revata over to their side, but on failing to do so, persuaded Revata’s pupil, Uttara, to accept robes, etc., from them, and speak to his teacher on their behalf. Uttara did this, but was dismissed by Revata as an unworthy pupil.<br/>Revata suggested that the dispute should be settled in Vesāli, and the monks having agreed, he visited Sabbakāmī—who was the oldest monk then living and a pupil of Ānanda—during the night, and talked to him on matters of doctrine. During the conversation, Sānavāsī arrived and questioned Sabbakāmī regarding the Ten Points, but the latter refused to express an opinion in private. On Revata’s suggestion a jury of eight, four from either side, was appointed to go into the question. Revata himself was a member of this jury, and he it was who questioned Sabbakāmī during the meeting, held in Vālikārāma, regarding the Ten Points. All the Ten Points were declared to be wrong, and, at the end of the questions, seven hundred monks—chosen from one hundred and twelve thousand, at the head of whom was Revata—held a recital of the Dhamma, which recital therefore came to be called Sattasatī. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.299ff.</c>

When the Buddha and Ānanda visited Kusinārā, the Malla chieftains decreed that whoever failed to pay homage to the Buddha would be fined five hundred coins. Rojā was Ānanda’s friend, and Ānanda was pleased when he arrived to pay homage to the Buddha, but when Rojā said that he did so only out of regard for his kinsmen’s decree, Ānanda was bitterly disappointed and asked the Buddha to discover some means by which Rojā could be made to become his follower. The Buddha agreed to do this, and by means of the power of his compassion, Rojā was induced to visit him again. The Buddha preached to Rojā, who asked, as a boon, that the monks should accept hospitality only from him. This request was refused by the Buddha, who said that Rojā must take his turn with others in showing hospitality to him and his monks. Finding that he had long to wait for his turn, Rojā made enquiries, and, discovering that the monks had no supply of green vegetables or pastry, he consulted Ānanda, and, with the Buddha’s sanction, offered these things to the Buddha and his monks. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.247ff.</c>

With such a stride, he had travelled for one hundred years, and yet failed to reach the world’s end, where there was no birth, old age, death, etc. That was true, agreed the Buddha; in this fathom long body is the world, its origin, its making and end, likewise the practice which leads to such end. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.61f.</c>

               </b>
               <br/>A powerful tribe of India in the time of the Buddha. They were certainly khattiyas, for on that ground they claimed a share of the Buddha’s relics. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.165</c> 
               <br/>Their capital was Vesāli, and they formed a part of the Vajjian confederacy, being often referred to as the Vajjīs. They were beautiful to look at and wore brilliantly coloured garments, riding in brightly painted carriages.<c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.96</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.219</c>  The Buddha once compared them to the gods of Tāvatiṃsā. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.96</c> 
               <br/>Though this would seem to indicate that they were very prosperous and rich, they do not appear to have lived in luxury and idleness. They are, on the contrary, spoken of <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.267f.</c>  as sleeping on straw couches, being strenuous and diligent and zealous in their service. They also practised seven conditions of welfare, which the Buddha claimed to have taught them at the Sārandada cetiya. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.73f.</c> 
               <br/>The young men among the Licchavis were evidently fond of archery, for mention is made <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.76</c>  of large numbers of them roving about in the Mahāvana, with bows and arrows, the strings set, and surrounded by hounds. They were a martial people and fond of “sport,” but we find one of their Elders, Mahānāma complaining <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.76</c>  of them to the Buddha— “The Licchavi youths are quick tempered, rough and greedy fellows; such presents as are sent by the members of their tribe sugar cane, jujubes, sweet cakes, sweetmeats, etc. they loot and eat; they slap the women and girls of their tribe on the back.” Violation of chastity was considered a serious offence among the Licchavis, and the assembly would even give its consent to a husband’s request that his unfaithful wife should be murdered. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.225</c> 
               <br/>According to the Buddhist books, the Licchavis were devout followers of the Buddha and held him in the highest esteem. Five hundred Licchavis once gave a garment each to Piṅgiyāni, because he recited a verse in praise of the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.239</c>  Even careless boys, referred to above as wandering about with hounds and bows and arrows, would lay aside their arms when they saw the Buddha seated under a tree and would surround him with clasped hands, eager to hear him. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.76</c>  There were numerous shrines in Vesāli itself, several of which are mentioned by name: Cāpāla, Sattambaka, Bahuputta, Gotama, Sārandada and Udena. It is, however, apparent from the Buddhist books themselves that Vesāli was also a stronghold of the Jains. The Buddha visited Vesāli at least three times, and is frequently mentioned as staying in Kūṭāgārasālā in Mahāvana. There the Licchavis visited him in large numbers, sometimes <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.133f.</c>  disturbing the calm of the spot and obliging resident monks to seek peace in Gosiṅgasālavana near by. Once, five hundred Licchavis invited the Buddha to a discussion held by them at the Sārandada-cetiya regarding the five kinds of treasures. The Buddha went and gave his opinion. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.167f.</c> 
               <br/>But not all the Licchavis were followers of the Buddha. When Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha visited the Buddha at Mahāvana, he was accompanied by five hundred Licchavis, who did not all salute the Buddha as their teacher, but showed him only such respect as was due to an honoured stranger. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.229</c>  Several eminent Licchavis are specially mentioned by name as having visited and consulted the Buddha; among whom are Mahānāma, Sīha, Bhaddiya, Sāḷha, Abhaya, Panditakumāra, Nandaka, Mahāli and Ugga. Several Licchavis, both men and women, joined the Order—e.g., the famous courtesan Ambapālī, Jentī, Sīha and Vāsitthī, and, among monks, Añjanavaniya, Vajjiputta and Sambhūta.<br/>The Licchavis were greatly admired for their system of government. It was a republic (gaṇa, saṅghā), all the leading members of which were called rājā. They held full and frequent assemblies at which problems affecting either the whole republic or individual members were fully discussed. The Buddha enjoins on the monks the observance of the same habits as practised by the Licchavis. These are given at. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.76f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.56</c> 
               <br/>In their political relationships with their neighbours, the Licchavis seem to have been on friendly terms with Bimbisāra, king of Māgadha, and with Pasenadi, king of Kosala. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.101</c> 
               <br/>After the death of Bimbisāra, Ajātasattu, in his desire for the expansion of Māgadha, resolved to destroy the Licchavis. In order to discover what the Buddha thought of his chances of success, he sent to him his minister Vassakāra. The Buddha predicted <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.72ff.</c>  that as long as the Licchavis remained united they were proof against any foe. But we also find reference to their giving up their earlier austere habits and to their fondness for soft pillows, long sleep and other luxuries. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.268</c>

               </b>
               <br/>A tribe in North India, to which the Buddha belonged. Their capital was Kapilavatthu. Mention is also made of other Sākyan settlements - e.g., Cātumā, Khomadussa, Sāmagāma, Devadaha, Sīlavatī, Nagaraka, Medatalumpa, Sakkhara and Ulumpa (q.v.). Within the Sākyan tribe there were probably several clans, gottā. The Buddha himself belonged to the Gotamagotta. It has been suggested (E.g., Thomas, op. cit., 22) that this was a brahmin clan, claiming descent from the ancient isi Gotama. The evidence for this suggestion is, however, very meagre. Nowhere do we find the Sākyans calling themselves brahmins. On the other hand, we find various clans claiming a share of the Buddha's relics on the ground that they, like the Buddha, were khattiyas <c c="#3b6bd3">D.ii.165</c> . It is stated a that the Sākyans were a haughty people. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.183</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">D.i.90</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">J. i.88</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">DhA.iii.163</c> . Hiouen Thsang, however, found them obliging and gentle in manners (Beal., op. cit., <c c="#3b6bd3">ii.14</c> .<br/>When the Buddha first visited them, after his Enlightenment, they refused to honour him on account of his youth. The Buddha then performed a miracle and preached the Vessantara Jātaka, and their pride was subdued. They evidently fond of sports and mention is made of a special school of archery conducted by a Sākyan family, called Vedhaññā <c c="#3b6bd3">D.iii.117</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">DA.iii.905</c> .<br/>The Sākyans evidently had no king. Theirs was a republican form of government, probably with a leader, elected from time to time. The administration and judicial affairs of the gotta were discussed in their Santhāgāra, or Mote Hall, at Kapilavatthu. See, e.g., <c c="#3b6bd3">D.i.91</c>  the Sākyans had a similar Mote Hall at Cātumā <c c="#3b6bd3">M.i.457</c> . The Mallas of Kusinārā also had a Santhāgāra <c c="#3b6bd3">D.ii.164</c> ; so did the Licchavis of Vesāli <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.233</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">M.i.228</c> .<br/>Ambattha (q.v.) once visited it on business; so did the envoys of Pasenadi, when he wished to marry a Sākyan maiden (see below). A new Mote Hall was built at Kapilavatthu while the Buddha was staying at the Nigrodhārāma, and he was asked to inaugurate it. This he did by a series of ethical discourses lasting through the night, delivered by himself, Ananda, and Moggallāna. <c c="#3b6bd3">M.i.353f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">S. iv.182f</c>  the hall is described at <c c="#3b6bd3">SA.iii.63</c>  cf. <c c="#3b6bd3">UdA.409</c> .<br/>The Sākyans were very jealous of the purity of their race; they belonged to the Ādiccagotta, (ādiccā nāma gottena, Sākiyā nāma jātiyā, <c c="#3b6bd3">Sn. vs.423</c> ) and claimed descent from Okkāka (q.v.). Their ancestors were the nine children of Okkāka, whom he banished in order to give the kingdom to Jantukumāra, his son by another queen. These nine children went towards Himavā, and, having founded Kapilavatthu (q.v. for details), lived there. To the eldest sister they gave the rank of mother, and the others married among themselves. The eldest sister, Piyā, later married Rāma, king of Benares, and their descendants became known as the Koliyans (see Koliyā for details). When Okkāka heard of this, he praised their action, saying, 'Sakyā vata bho kumārā, paramasakyā vata bho rājakumāra; hence their name came to be 'Sakyā.'<br/>The Buddha states, in the Aggañña Sutta, that the Sākyans were vassals of King Pasenadi of Kosala. <c c="#3b6bd3">D.iii.83</c>  (Sakyā . . . Pasenadi-Kosalassa anuyuttā bhavanti, karonti Sakyā rañño Pasenadimhi Kosale nipaccakāram abhivādanam paccupatthānam añjalikammam sāmīcikammam); cf. <c c="#3b6bd3">Sn.vs 422</c> , where the Buddha describes his country as being 'Kosalesu niketino.'<br/>

There, at his request, the Buddha visited him and comforted him. He questioned Vakkali, who assured him that he had no cause to reprove himself with regard to morals; his only worry was that he had not been able to see the Buddha earlier. The Buddha told him that seeing the Dhamma was equivalent to seeing him, and because Vakkali had realized the Dhamma, there would be no hereafter for him. After the Buddha had left, Vakkali asked his attendants to take him to Kāḷasilā on Isigili. The Buddha was on Gijjhakūṭa and was told by two devas that Vakkali was about to “obtain release.” The Buddha sent word to him— “Fear not, Vakkali, your dying will not be evil.” Vakkali rose from his bed to receive the Buddha’s message, and sending word to the Buddha that he had no desire or love for the body or the other khandhas, he drew a knife and killed himself. The Buddha went to see his body, and declared that he had obtained Nibbāna and that Māra’s attempt to find the consciousness of Vakkali would prove useless.<br/>

               </b>
               <br/>A wanderer who later became an arahant Thera. Several conversations he had with the Buddha are mentioned in the books. For details see the Tevijja Vacchagotta-, Aggi Vacchagotta-, Mahā Vacchagotta-, Vaccha—and Vacchagotta-Suttas. The Saṃyutta Nikāya contains a whole section on Vacchagotta; his discussions were chiefly concerned with such mythical questions as to whether the world is eternal, the nature of life, the existence or otherwise of the Tathāgata after death, etc. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.257ff.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.391ff.</c>  The three Vacchagotta Suttas of the Majjhima Nikāya seem to contain the story of Vacchagotta’s conversion, in due order: at the conclusion of the Tevijja Vacchagotta it is merely stated that “the Paribbājaka Vacchagotta rejoiced in what the Blessed One has said.” At the end of the next, the Aggi Vacchagotta, he is mentioned as having accepted the Buddha as his teacher. In the third, the Mahā Vacchagotta, he seeks ordination from the Buddha at Rājagaha, and receives it after the requisite probationary period of four months. He returns to the Buddha after two weeks and tells him that he has attained all that is to be attained by a non arahant’s understanding and asks for a further exposition of the Doctrine. The Buddha tells him to proceed to the study of calm and insight, whereby sixfold abhiññā may be acquired. Vacchagotta profits by the lesson and soon after becomes an arahant. He thereupon sends news of his attainment to the Buddha through some monks, and the Buddha says he has already heard the news from the devas. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.493–497</c> 
               <br/>This story definitely identifies the Paribbājaka with the Thera of the same name, whose verse of ecstasy is included in the Theragāthā. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.112</c> 
               <br/>Vacchagotta was a native of Rājagaha, but seems to have travelled widely, for we find him visiting the Buddha at Vesāli, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.481</c>  at Sāvatthī, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.483</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iii.257</c>  and at Ñātikā, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.401</c>  in addition to his visits to Rājagaha. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.489</c> 
               <br/>in the Aṅguttara Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.180f.</c>  a Vacchagotta who is a wanderer visits the Buddha at Venāgapura, where he was at the head of the brahmins. He is possibly the same person, though here he is called Venāgapurika.<br/>

It was Vajirapāṇi’s duty to frighten such people by appearing before them in the sky, armed with a thunderbolt, which he was ready to hurl if necessary. He was visible only to the Buddha and the person in question.<br/>Two instances of this are given in the books—once in the case of Ambaṭṭha, <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.95</c>  and again in that of Saccaka Nigaṇṭhaputta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.231</c>

               <br/>A householder of Campā, a devout and skilled follower of the Buddha. Once, when on his way to see the Buddha at Gaggarā Lake, he found he had arrived too early and went into the Paribbājakārāma near by. The Paribbājakas asked him if it was true that the Buddha ridicules all forms of asceticism and austerity. They spoke of the Buddha as a teacher of a discipline which he himself did not follow, a nihilist. Vajjiyamāhita refuted their arguments, maintaining that the Buddha declared what was good and what was bad, and that the truth of his teachings could be proved. Having thus silenced them, he sought the Buddha, to whom he repeated the conversation. The Buddha praised him, and said it was untrue that he discouraged all austerity and asceticism; such penances as led to the destruction of evil states and the promotion of good states, he welcomed and encouraged. When Vajjiyamāhita had left him, the Buddha held him up to the monks as an example of a good householder, capable of profitable discussion with followers of other persuasions. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.189ff.</c>

               <br/>The name of a country and of its people. It was one of the sixteen Great Nations. The inhabitants appear to have consisted of several confederate clans of whom the Licchavī and the Videhā were the chief. The names Vajjī and Licchavī were often synonymous. In one passage <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.76</c>  the Licchavi, Mahānāma, seeing that a band of young Licchavis who had been out hunting were gathered round the Buddha, is represented as saying, “These Licchavis will yet become Vajjians”.<br/> Vesāli was the capital of the Licchavis and Mithilā of the Videhas. In the time of the Buddha, both Vesāli and Mithilā were republics, though Mithilā had earlier been a kingdom under Janaka.<br/>In the time of the Buddha, and even up to his death, the Vajjians were a very prosperous and happy community. The Buddha attributed this to the fact that they practiced the seven conditions of welfare taught to them by himself in the Sārandada Cetiya.<br/>The Buddha travelled several times through the Vajjian country, the usual route being through Kosala, Malla, Vajji, Kāsi, Māgadha, and thus back, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.348</c>  and he preached to the people, mostly in the Kūṭāgārasālā in Vesāli. Among other places besides Vesāli visited by the Buddha, are mentioned Ukkacela, Koṭigāma, Nādikā, Beluvagāma, Bhaṇḍagāma, Bhogagāma and Hatthigāma. Pubbavijjhana, the birthplace of Channa, is also mentioned as a village of the Vajjians. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.59</c>  The Vaggumudā river flowed through Vajjian territory. <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.iii.3</c>

               </b>
               <br/>A brahmin, chief minister of Ajātasattu. He and Sunidha were in charge of the fortifications of Pāṭaligāma, built against the Vajjī. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.228</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.viii.6</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.72ff.</c> 
               <br/>At Ajātasattu’s suggestion, Vassakāra visited the Buddha to discover, indirectly, whether, in the Buddha’s view, there were any chances of Ajātasattu conquering the Vajjians in battle. The Buddha said that as long as the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of prosperity which he had taught them at Sārandada cetiya, they would prosper rather than decline.<br/>In the Gopaka Moggallāna Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.iii.8ff.</c>  Vassakāra is represented as arriving in the middle of a conversation, which Gopaka Moggallāna was holding with Ānanda, having been sent to inspect the works at Rājagaha, which were in charge of Moggallāna. Having asked the subject of conversation, he inquired whether the Buddha himself or the Order had chosen a leader for the Saṅgha after the Buddha’s death. Ānanda explains that the Buddha did not do so, that no special leader has been appointed, but that there were monks to whom they showed honour and reverence because of their virtue and insight. Vassakāra admits this as good, as does also Upananda, the Senāpati, who is present. Vassakāra asks Ānanda where he lives, and is told, in Veḷuvana. Vassakāra thinks this a good place for the practice of jhāna, and tells Ānanda of a conversation he once had with the Buddha regarding jhāna. Ānanda, remarks that all jhānas are not equally praiseworthy, and Vassakāra takes his leave.<br/>Three conversations between the Buddha and Vassakāra are recorded in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, all three taking place at Veḷuvana.<br/>On discovering that a certain forest official had given tribute to Dhaniya without the king’s special leave, he reported the man to the king and had him punished. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.42ff.</c>  In this context we find that Vassakāra was Mahāmatta to Bimbisāra as well.<br/>

The kingdom bordered on the Ganges, on one side of which was Māgadha and on the other Videha. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.225</c>  Adjacent to it were Kāsi and Kosala. One of Bimbisāra’s queens was probably from Videha. In earlier times Videha was evidently a kingdom, its best known kings being Mahājanaka and Nimi; but in the Buddha’s time it was a republic, part of the Vajjian federation. According to the Mahāgovinda Sutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.235</c>  it was King Reṇu who, with the help of Mahāgovinda Jotipāla, founded the Videha kingdom.<br/>

               <br/>Vepacitti was the friend of Rāhu, and when Rāhu seized Candimā and Suriya and these invoked the power of the Buddha, it was to Vepacitti that Rāhu fled for comfort.<c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.50</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.51</c>  The Asuras being once defeated in a fight with the Devas, the latter took Vepacitti prisoner, and brought him, bound hand and foot, to Sakka in the Sudhamma hall. There Vepacitti reviled and railed at Sakka with scurrilous words, both on entering and on leaving the hall, but Sakka remained silent, and, when questioned by Mātali, said it was not proper for him to bandy words with a fool. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.221f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.201</c>  His bondage caused him no inconvenience so long as he remained with the devas, but the moment he experienced the wish to rejoin the Asuras, he felt himself bound. Vepacitti’s capture is referred to in the Theragāthā. <c c="#3b6bd3">Thag.749</c> 
               <br/>On another occasion Vepacitti suggested that victory should be given to him or to Sakka, according to their excellence in speech. Sakka agreed to this, and Vepacitti, as the older god, was asked to speak a verse. Sakka spoke another, the Devas applauding. Several verses were spoken by each, and both Devas and Asuras decided in favour of Sakka, because Vepacitti’s verses belonged, they said, to the sphere of violence, while those of Sakka belonged to one of concord and harmony. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.222f.</c>  Once, when Sakka was revolving in his mind the thought that he should not betray even his enemy, Vepacitti read his thoughts and came up to him. “Stop,” said Sakka, “thou art my prisoner”; but Vepacitti reminded him of his thought, and was allowed to go free. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.225</c> 
               <br/>When Vepacitti lay ill, Sakka visited him and offered to cure him if he would teach him Sambara’s magic art. Vepacitti consulted the Asuras, and, as they were unwilling, he refused Sakka’s offer, warning him that Sambara, having practised magic, was suffering in purgatory and that he should avoid a similar fate. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.238f.</c> 
               <br/>Mention is made <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.226</c>  of a visit once paid by Sakka and Vepacitti to a company of seers dwelling in a forest hut. Vepacitti, in his buskins, his sword hanging at his side and his state canopy borne over his head, entered by the main gate, while Sakka, in all humility, used the side gate.<br/>

                  <c c="#a00149">Verañjā</c>
               </b>
               <br/>A town in which the Buddha once spent the rainy season at the invitation of the brahmin Verañja. Verañja visits the Buddha at the foot of the Naḷerupucimanda, where he is staying, and asks him a series of questions, the first of which is: whether it be true that the Buddha pays no respect to aged brahmins. The Buddha replies that he has not seen a brahmin in the whole world to whom such respect is due from him. If the Tathāgata were so to honour anyone, that person’s head would split in pieces. Other questions follow on the Buddha’s doctrine and practices. The Buddha concludes by giving an account of his attainment of the threefold knowledge. The interview ends with the conversion of Verañja and his invitation to the Buddha to spend his rainy season there.<br/>At that time there was a famine, and five hundred householders of Uttarāpatha, staying at Verañjā, supplied the monks with food. Moggallāna proposed to get food by the exercise of his magic power or by going with the monks to Uttarakuru, but he was dissuaded by the Buddha. During this stay Sāriputta received from the Buddha an explanation as to why the religious systems of the three previous Buddhas lasted so long, while those of the three preceding them—Vipassī, Sikhī and Vesabhū—did not.<br/>At the conclusion of the vassa, the Buddha wished to take leave of Verañja before setting out, as was the custom of Buddhas when they received hospitality. Verañja admitted that, though he had invited the Buddha, he had not kept his promise, and this was due to his having too many duties in the house.<br/>He invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal the next day, and, at the end of the meal, presented a set of three robes to the Buddha and a pair to each of the monks.<br/>After leaving Verañjā the Buddha went to Benares, passing through Soreyya, Saṅkassa and Kaṇṇakujja, and crossing the Ganges at Payāgapatiṭṭhāna. From Benares he proceeded to Vesāli. This account, of the Buddha’s visit to Verañjā, forms the introduction to the Vinaya. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.1–11</c>  The interview with Verañja is given in the Aṅguttara. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.172ff.</c> 
               <br/>A road led from Verañjā to Madhurā, and the Aṅguttara Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.57f.</c>  contains a sermon preached by the Buddha to a large number of people while he rested by the roadside. There was evidently frequent intercourse between Sāvatthī and Verañjā, and the Verañjaka Sutta was preached to some brahmins who visited the Buddha at Sāvatthī, whither they had gone on business. The books also record <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.198f.</c>  a visit paid by the Asura Pahārāda to the Buddha at Verañjā.<br/>

A pupil of hers, having visited Udāyi, then staying in the Todeyya mango grove, told her of his excellences.<br/>He was asked to invite Udāyī to a meal, and, when it was over, the teacher put on her sandals, sat on a high seat, and, with her head veiled, asked Udāyī to preach the doctrine. “A time will come for that, sister,” he said, and went away. Three times this happened, and then she told her pupil. He pointed out to her her mistake in not showing respect for the Doctrine. The next time Udāyī came, she approached him after the meal with all humility and asked him what, according to the arahants, was the cause of weal and woe. “The existence of the senses,” answered Udāyī; and she, expressing her satisfaction, declared herself a follower of Udāyī. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.121f.</c>

Vessavaṇa happened to be passing over her house on his way from north to south, and hearing the song, stopped at her window to praise it and to reveal his identity. She greeted him cordially, and in return for her greeting he announced to her that Sāriputta and Moggallāna were on their way to Velukanta. She, delighted with the news, made all preparations and sent word to the monastery, inviting the monks to the house. After the meal, she informed the Elders that Vessavaṇa had told her of their arrival. When they expressed their amazement, she told them of several other virtues possessed by her. Her only son Nanda was seized by the king’s men and killed before her eyes, but she experienced no disquiet, nor did she when her husband, after his death, having been born as a Yakkha, revealed himself to her. She was guilty of no transgression of the precepts, could enter into the four jhānas at will, and had cast off the five lower fetters. The monks expressed their great admiration and Sāriputta preached to her. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.63ff.</c>

When the Buddha first visited Rājagaha, after his Enlightenment, he stayed at the Latthivanuyyāna. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.35</c>  The day after his arrival, he accepted the king’s invitation to a meal at the palace, at the end of which the king, seeking a place for the Buddha to live “not too far from the town, not too near, suitable for coming and going, easily accessible to all people, by day not too crowded, by night not exposed to noise and clamour, clean of the smell of people, hidden from men and well fitted to seclusion” decided on Veḷuvana, and bestowed it on the Buddha and the fraternity. This was the first monastery accepted by the Buddha, and a rule was passed allowing monks to accept such a monastery. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.39f.</c> 
               <br/>The Buddha at once went to stay there, and it was during this stay that Sāriputta and Moggallāna joined the Order. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.42</c> 
               <br/>Kalaṇḍakanivāpa is the place nearly always mentioned as the spot where the Buddha stayed in Veḷuvana. There many Vinaya rules were passed—e.g., on the keeping of the vassa, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.137</c>  the use of food cooked in the monastery, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.210f.</c>  the picking of edible fruit in the absence of any layman from whom permission to do so could be obtained, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.212</c>  surgical operations on monks, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.215f.</c>  the eating of sugar, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.226</c>  the rubbing of various parts of the body against wood, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.105</c>  the use of the kinds of dwelling, <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.146</c>  and the use of gold and money. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.196</c>

               </b>
               <br/>A city, capital of the Licchavis. It is not possible to know how many visits were paid by the Buddha to Vesāli, but the books would lead us to infer that they were several. Various Vinaya rules are mentioned as having been laid down at Vesāli. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.238</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.287f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.118</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.119–127</c> 
               <br/>It was during a stay in Vesāli, whither he had gone from Kapilavatthu, that Mahā Pajāpatī Gotamī followed the Buddha with five hundred other Sākyan women, and, with the help of Ānanda’s intervention, obtained permission for women to enter the Order. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.ii.253ff.</c> 
               <br/>The books describe <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.95ff.</c>  at some length the Buddha’s last visit to Vesāli on his way to Kusinārā. On the last day of this visit, after his meal, he went with Ānanda to Cāpāla cetiya for his siesta, and, in the course of their conversation, he spoke to Ānanda of the beauties of Vesāli: of the Udena cetiya, the Gotamaka cetiya, the Sattambaka cetiya, the Bahuputta cetiya, and the Sārandada cetiya. Other monasteries are also mentioned, in or near Vesāli e.g., Pātikārāma, Vālikārāma.<br/>The Buddha generally stayed at the Kūṭāgārasālā during his visits to Vesāli, but it appears that he sometimes lived at these different shrines. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.118</c>  During his last visit to the Cāpāla cetiya he decided to die within three months, and informed Māra and, later, Ānanda, of his decision. The next day he left Vesāli for Bhaṇḍagāma, after taking one last look at the city, “turning his whole body round, like an elephant”. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.122</c>  The rainy season which preceded this, the Buddha spent at Beluvagāma, a suburb of Vesāli, while the monks stayed in and around Vesāli. On the day before he entered into the vassa, Ambapāli invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal, at the conclusion of which she gave her Ambavana for the use of the Order. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.98</c> 
               <br/>Among eminent followers of the Buddha who lived in Vesāli, special mention is made of Ugga, Piṅgiyāni, Kāraṇapālī, Sīha, Vāseṭṭha, <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.258</c>  and the various Licchavis.<br/>Vesāli was a stronghold of the Nigaṇṭhas. The Buddha’s presence in Vesāli was a source of discomfort to the Nigaṇṭhas, and we find mention of various devices resorted to by them to prevent their followers from coming under the influence of the Buddha.<br/>At the time of the Buddha, Vesāli was a very large city, rich and prosperous, crowded with people and with abundant food. Its courtesan, Ambapālī, was famous for her beauty, and helped in large measure in making the city prosperous. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.268</c> 
               <br/>Outside the town was the Mahāvana, a large, natural forest. Near by were other forests, such as Gosiṅgalasāla. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.134</c> 
               <br/>Among important suttas preached at Vesāli are the Mahāli, Mahāsīhanāda, Cūḷa Saccaka, Mahā Saccaka, Tevijja, Vacchagotta, Sunakkhatta and Ratana.<br/>One hundred years after the Buddha’s death Vesāli was again the scene of interest for Buddhists, on account of the “Ten Points” raised by the Vajjiputtaka, and the second Council held in connection with this dispute at the Vālikārāma.<br/>There were Nāgas living in Vesāli; these were called Vesālā. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.258</c>

The Saṃyutta Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.229</c>  contains a list of his names.<br/>Maghavā, because as a human being, in a former birth, he was a brahmin named Magha.Purindada (generous giver in former births or giver in towns) because, as Māgha, he bestowed gifts from time to time. (Cf. Indra’s epithet Purandara, destroyer of cities) Sakka, because he gives generously and thoroughly (sakkaccaṃ). Sakra occurs many times in the Vedas as an adjective, qualifying gods (chiefly Indra), and is explained as meaning “able, capable.” It is, however, not found as a name in pre Buddhist times.Vāsava, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.221</c>

According to the Dīgha Nikāya, <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.260</c>  however, he is Vāsava because he is chief of the Vasū.Sahassakkha or Sahassanetta (Thousand-eyed) because in one moment he can think of one thousand matters.Sujampati, because he married the Asura maiden SujāElsewhere <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.270</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.252</c>  Sakka is addressed as Kosiya.<br/>He is also spoken of as Yakkha. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.252</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.206</c>  ; at S.i.47 Māghadevaputta is called Vatrabhū, slayer of Vṛṭra.<br/>Sakka rules over Tāvatiṃsā, the lowest heaven. His palace is Vejayanta and his chariot bears the same name. Though king of the Tāvatiṃsā devas, he is no absolute monarch. He is imagined rather in the likeness of a chieftain of a Kosala clan. The devas meet and deliberate in the Sudhamma sabhā and Sakka consults with them rather than issues them commands. On such occasions, the Four Regent Devas are present in the assembly with their followers of the Cātummahārājika world.<c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.207f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.220f.</c>  Among the Tāvatiṃsā devas, Sakka surpasses his companions in ten things: length of life, beauty, happiness, renown, power; and in the degree of his five sense experiences: sight, hearing, smelling, taste and touch. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.242</c> 
               <br/>In the Saṃyutta Nikāya <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.228</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.229</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.231</c>  the Buddha gives seven rules of conduct, which rules Sakka carried out as a human being, thus attaining to his celestial sovereignty. When the devas fight the Asuras they do so under the banner and orders of Sakka.<br/>In the Saṃyutta Nikāya a whole Saṃyutta—one of the shortest, consisting of twenty five short suttas—is devoted to Sakka.<br/>Sakka was considered by the early Buddhists as a god of high character, kindly and just, but not perfect, and not very intelligent. His imperfections are numerous: in spite of his very great age, he is still subject to death and rebirth <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.144</c>  ; as an example of this, it is mentioned that Sunetta had thirty five times been reborn as Sakka, <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.105</c>  a statement confirmed by the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.89</c> 
               <br/>In the Sakkapañha Sutta, Sakka is said to have visited the Buddha at Vediyagiri in Ambasaṇḍā and to have asked him a series of questions. He sends Pañcasikha with his vinā to play and sing to the Buddha and to obtain permission for him to visit him and question him.<br/>The Buddha says to himself that Sakka, for a long time past, has led a pure life, and gives him permission to question him on any subject. It is stated in the course of the sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.270</c>  that it was not the first time that Sakka had approached the Buddha for the same purpose. He had gone to him at the Salaghara in Sāvatthī, but found him in meditation, with Bhuñjatī, wife of Vessavaṇa, waiting on him. He therefore left with a request to Bhuñjatī to greet the Buddha in his name. He also declares <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.286</c>  that he has become a sotāpanna and has earned for himself the right to be reborn eventually in the Akaniṭṭhā world, whence he will pass entirely away. Sakka admits <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.284</c>  that he visited other brahmins and recluses as well. They were pleased to see him, and boasted that they had nothing to teach him; but he had to teach them what he knew.<br/>An account of another interview which Sakka had with the Buddha is given in the Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta. There the question arises regarding the extirpation of cravings. Sakka accepts the Buddha’s answer and leaves him. Anxious to discover whether Sakka has understood the Buddha’s teaching, Moggallāna visits Sakka and questions him. Sakka evades the questions and shows Moggallāna the glories of his Vejayanta palace. Moggallāna then frightens him by a display of iddhi-power, and Sakka repeats to him, word for word, the Buddha’s answer. Moggallāna departs satisfied, and Sakka tells his handmaidens that Moggallāna is a “fellow of his” in the higher life, meaning, probably, that he himself is a sotāpanna and therefore a kinsman of the arahant.<br/>In a passage in the Saṃyutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.201</c>  Sakka is represented as descending from heaven to make an enquiry about Nibbāna, and in another <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.269f.</c>  as listening, in heaven, to Moggallāna’s exposition of the simplest duties of a good layman. On another occasion, at Vessavaṇa’s suggestion, Sakka visited Uttara Thera on the Sankheyyaka Mountain and listened to a sermon by him. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.163f.</c>

               <br/>A very learned brahmin of Candalakappa. One day he saw Dhānañjānī trip up, and heard her exclaim three times, “Glory to the Buddha, the arahant, the all enlightened.” He blamed her for thus extolling a shovelling monk, but when she told him of the Buddha’s marvellous qualities, he felt a desire to see him. Some time after, the Buddha went to Candalakappa and stayed in Todeyya’s Mango grove. When Dhānañjānī told Saṅgārava that he was there, Saṅgārava visited him and questioned him on his views on brahmins. The Buddha said he had great regard for brahmins who had here and now won the goal, having discovered unaided a doctrine before unknown. He himself was one of these. He then proceeds to describe how he came to leave the household life and how, in due course, he won Enlightenment. Saṅgārava asks further whether there are any gods. The Buddha answers that of that there is no doubt; the whole world is in agreement on that point. Saṅgārava is pleased and accepts the Buddha as his teacher. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.209ff.</c> 
               <br/>The Saṃyutta <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.182f.</c>  mentions a Saṅgārava who is perhaps distinct from the above. He lived in Sāvatthī and was a “bath ritualist,” believing in purification by water, bathing morning and evening. The Buddha, at Ānanda’s request, visited his house and preached to him the Doctrine, after which he became the Buddha’s follower.<br/>Another Saṃyutta passage <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.121f.</c>  contains a sutta in which the brahmin Saṅgārava visits the Buddha and asks him why he can remember certain mantras with great case and others not at all.

Sañjaya is sent for by Pasenadi, but, on being questioned, says that Viḍūḍabha was responsible for the statement. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.127</c>

               </b> (3)  Belaṭṭhiputta<br/>One of the six famous heretical teachers of the Buddha’s day. He was a great skeptic, his teaching being the evasion of problems and the suspension of judgment. His doctrines seem to have been identical with those of the Amarāvikkhepikas (Eel wrigglers) who, when asked a question, would equivocate and wriggle like an eel. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.58</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.27</c> 
               <br/>He is evidently identical with Sañjaya the Paribbājaka who was the original teacher of Sāriputta and Moggallāna. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.39</c>  It is said that when these two disciples left Sañjaya to become pupils of the Buddha, they were joined by two hundred and fifty others. Sañjaya then fainted, and hot blood issued from his mouth. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.42</c> 
               <br/>Perhaps the Aviruddhakas mentioned in the Aṅguttara <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.276</c>  were also followers of Sañjaya— they were called Amarāvikkhepakā for their philosophical doctrines, and Aviruddhakā for their moral conduct.<br/>

               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.v.327</c>  he is mentioned as the author of a famous verse, which is eleswhere attribued to the Buddha. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.284</c>  Sanaṅkumāra is represented as a very devout follower of the Buddha.<br/>In a sutta of the Saṃyutta, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.153</c>  he is spoken of as visiting the Buddha on the banks of the Sappinī, and it was during this visit that the above verse was spoken. Sanaṅkumāra was present at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.261</c> 
               <br/>In the Janavasabha Sutta, Janavasabha describes to the Buddha an occasion on which Sanaṅkumāra attended an assembly of the Devas, presided over by Sakka and the Four Regent Gods. There was suddenly a vast radiance, and the devas knew of the approach of Sanaṅkumāra. As the usual appearance of the Brahmā is not sufficiently materialized for him to be perceived by the Devas of Tāvatiṃsā, he is forced to appear as a relatively gross personality which he specially creates. As he arrives, the Devas sit in their places with clasped hands waiting for him to choose his seat. Then Sanaṅkumāra takes on the form of Pañcasikha and sits, above the assembly, cross legged, in the air. So seated, he expresses his satisfaction that Sakka and all the Tāvatiṃsā Devas should honour and follow the Buddha. His voice has all the eight characteristics of a Brahmā’s voice. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.211</c>  He then proceeds to create thirty three shaper, of himself, each sitting on the divan of a Tāvatiṃsā Deva, and addresses the Devas, speaking of the advantages of taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha. Each deva fancies that only the shape sitting on his own divan has spoken and that the others are silent. Then Sanaṅkumāra goes to the end of the Hall, and, seated on Sakka’s throne, addresses the whole assembly on the four ways of iddhi; on the three avenues leading to Bliss, as manifested by the Buddha; on the four satipaṭṭhānas, and the seven samādhiparikkhārā. He declares that more than twenty four lakhs of Māgadha disciples, having followed the teachings of the Buddha, have been born in the deva worlds. When Sanaṅkumāra has finished his address, Vessavaṇa wonders if there have been Buddhas in the past and will be in the future. The Brahmā reads his thoughts and says there certainly were and will be.<br/>

The first is with Musila and deals with the paṭiccasamuppāda. Musila, in answer to Savittha’s questions, says that he has realized the truth of the paṭiccasamuppāda as his very own. “Then you are an arahant,” says Savittha, and Musila remains silent. In the other conversation, Nārada, present at the discussion, in the company of Ānanda, requests that the same questions be put to him. This Savittha does, and he tells Savittha that he has realized the truth of the Paṭiccasamuppāda by right insight and that, yet, he is not an arahant. He is like a man who sees a well containing water, but who has neither rope nor vessel. “Now, what will you say of Nārada?” asks Ānanda. “Nothing that is not lovely and good,” answers Savittha.<br/>

               <br/>A Mahābrahmā. When the Buddha was at the Ajapālanigrodha, hesitating as to whether or not he should preach the Dhamma, Sahampati appeared before him and begged of him to open to the world the doors of Immortality. The Buddha agreed to this urgent request <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.5f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.137f.</c>  and accepted from Sahampati the assurance that all the Buddhas of the past had also had no other teacher than the Dhamma discovered by them. Similar passages are found elsewhere. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.139</c>

               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.10f.</c> 
               <br/>Sahampati once saw that the brahminee, mother of Brahmadeva Thera, habitually made offerings to Brahmā. Out of compassion for her, Sahampati appeared before her and exhorted her to give her offerings to Brahmadeva instead. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.140f.</c>  On another occasion, when Kokāliya died and was born in Padumaniraya, Sahampati appeared before the Buddha and announced the fact to him.<c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.p.125</c>

The verses are in praise of the life and practices of the monks and of the results thereof. Sahampati again visited the Buddha, simultaneously with Sakka, and as they stood leaning against a doorpost of the Buddha’s cell, Sakka uttered a verse in praise of the Buddha. Sahampati then added another verse, exhorting the Buddha to preach the Doctrine, as there were those who would understand. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.233</c>  A verse spoken by him immediately after the Buddha’s death is included in the books. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.157</c>

               <br/>A town in Kosala. It was regarded in the Buddha’s time as one of the six great cities of India, the others being Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthī, Kosambī and Benares. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.146</c>  In the Vinaya <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.253</c>  however, the distance between āvatthī and Sāketa is given as six leagues. The town lay on the direct route between Sāvatthī and Patiṭṭhāna, and is mentioned <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.1011–1013</c>  as the first stopping place out of Sāvatthī. The distance between the two places could be covered in one day, with seven relays of horses, <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.149</c>  but the books contain several references <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.88</c>

The road was infested with robbers, and the king had to maintain soldiers to protect travellers.<br/>Midway between Sāketa and Sāvatthī was Toraṇavatthu, and it is said <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.iv.374ff.</c>  that, when Pasenadi went from the capital to Sāketa, he spent a night in Toraṇavatthu, where be visited Khemā Therī who lived there. Between Sāketa and Sāvatthī was a broad river which could be crossed only by boat.<c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.65</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.228</c>  Near Sāketa was the Añjanavana, where the Buddha sometimes stayed during his visits to Sāketa and where he had several discussions e.g., with Kakudha, <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.54</c>  Mendasira, and Kuṇḍaliya. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.73</c> 
               <br/>On other occasions he stayed at the Kāḷakārāma <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.ii.24</c>  gifted to the Order by Kāḷaka, and the Tikantakivana, <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.169</c>  both of which were evidently near the city. Mention is also made <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.v.174</c>

Once when Ānanda was staying in the Migadāya in the Añjanavana, a nun, described as Jatilagāhikā, visited him and questioned him regarding concentration. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.427</c>  Among others who lived in Sāketa were Jambugāmikaputta, Gavampati, Mendasira, Uttara, Madhuvāsettha and his son Mahānāga, and Visākhā. Bhūta Thera was born in a suburb of Sāketa.<br/>The Vinaya <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.270f.</c>  mentions another seṭṭhi of Sāketa. His wife had suffered for seven years from a disease of the head, and even skilled physicians failed to cure her. Jīvaka, on his way to Rājagaha, after finishing his studies in Takkasilā, visited Sāketa, heard of her illness, and offered to cure her. At first the seṭṭhi was sceptic, but in the end allowed Jīvaka to attend on his wife. Jīvaka cured her by the administration of ghee through the nose, and, as reward, received sixteen thousand kahāpanas from her and her various kinsmen.<br/>

               <br/>He was the personal attendant of the Buddha at he time when Soṇa Kolvisa visited Bimbisāra, with overseers of the eighty thousand townships of Bimbisāra’s kingdom. Sāgata was endowed with supernatural power, and the overseers, who went to visit the Buddha at Gijjhakūṭa, were very impressed by his iddhi, so much so that even while the Buddha was preaching they could not take their eyes off him. The king thereupon asked Sāgata to show them a greater marvel, and Sāgata, having shown in the open sky wonders of various kinds, fell at the Buddha’s feet and declared the Buddha his teacher. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.179f.</c> 
               <br/>Later, when the Buddha went to stay in Bhaddavatikā, having heard men warn the Buddha of the proximity of a Nāga of great power in the Jaṭila hermitage at Ambatiṭṭha, Sāgata went there and lived in the Nāga’s abode. The Nāga showed great resentment, but Sāgata overpowered him with his iddhi and then returned to Bhaddavatikā. From there he went with the Buddha to Kosambī, where the lay disciples, hearing of his wondrous feat, paid him great honour. When they asked what they could do for his comfort, he remained silent, but the Chabbaggiyā suggested that they should provide him with white spirits.<br/>The next day, when Sāgata went for alms, he was invited to various houses, where the inmates plied him with intoxicating drinks. So deep were his potations that on his way out of the town he fell prostrate at the gateway. The monks carried him, and at the monastery they laid him down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, but he turned round so that his feet lay towards the Buddha. The Buddha pointed out his condition to the monks, using it as an example of the evil effects of liquor; and he made this the occasion for the passing of a rule against the use of alcohol. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iv.108f.</c> 
               <br/>The Buddha later declared him foremost among those skilled in the contemplation of the heat element. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.25</c>

               <br/>He was a fisherman’s son and held the false view that, according to the Buddha’s teaching, a man’s consciousness runs on and continues without break of identity. Sāti’s colleagues did their best to change his way of thinking, but failing to do so, they reported the matter to the Buddha. He questioned Sāti, who, however, sat silent and glum; then the Buddha preached to him and the assembled monks the Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.256ff.</c>

The latter was overwhelmed with grief, and, when Sānu visited her, he found her weeping.

This was shortly after the Buddha’s Awakening. Sāriputta soon became enlightened, and became a popular teacher, well respected by the other monks, and often praised by the Buddha. He features in many Suttas as a teacher. He passed away shortly before the Buddha.<br/>

               </b> (1) <br/>A Licchavi general of Vesāli. He was a follower of the Nigaṇṭhas. When the Buddha visited Vesāli, Sīha, having heard reports of his greatness, wished to see him, but Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta dissuaded him, saying that Gotama denied the result of actions and was not worth a visit. But in the end Sīha, accompanied by five hundred chariots, went to the Buddha. Having discovered in conversation with the Buddha that he was falsely accused of preaching wrong doctrines, Sīha declared himself the Buddha’s follower. The Buddha accepted his adherence on condition that he would continue to give alms to any Nigaṇṭhas who sought them at his house. This generosity made Sīha honour the Buddha even more highly, and he invited him and the monks to a meal on the next day. Meat formed one of the dishes, and the Nigaṇṭhas went about Vesāli crying that Sīha had killed a large ox to provide meat for the Buddha and his monks and that the food had been accepted. This was the occasion for the formulation of the rule that no monk should eat flesh where he has reason to believe that the animal had been specially killed for him. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.233f.</c>

The Buddha, by means of a counter question, elicits from Sīha that the giver has his reward in this world itself, and in the end Sīha acknowledges that he has experienced the benefits which the Buddha set forth.<br/>

               </b> Kalandakaputta<br/>A monk who, after being ordained, returned to his former wife and had relations with her, thus becoming guilty of the first Pārājika offence. When there was a famine in the Vajji country, Sudinna went to Vesāli, hoping to be kept by his rich relations, to the mutual benefit of both parties. They gave him sixty bowls of rice, which he distributed among his colleagues. When he went to his father’s house, in Kalandakagāma, he saw a servant girl about to throw away some boiled rice and asked her to put it into his bowl. The girl, recognizing his hands and feet and voice, told his mother of his arrival. Both she and his father visited him as he was eating the rice, and his father took him by the hand and led him home. There he was provided with a seat and asked to eat: but he refused, saying he had already eaten. The next day he was again invited; he went, and they tried to tempt him back to the lay life. His former wife joined in the attempt, but on being addressed by him as “Sister,” she fell fainting. Then he begged for his meal, saying that if they desired to give it to him they should do so without worrying him. Later his wife visited him, with his mother, at the Mahāvana, and begged that he would give her a son, so that the Licchavis might not confiscate their wealth for want of an heir. Sudinna agreed, and had intercourse three times with her. She became pregnant, and in due course a son was born, who was called Bījaka. When Sudinna realized what he had done he was filled with remorse, and his colleagues, discovering the reason, reported him to the Buddha, who blamed him greatly. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.iii.11–21</c>

One day Sāriputta, at the head of several eminent monks, visited Macchikāsaṇḍa and stayed in the monastery. Citta heard Sāriputta preach, and, at the end of the sermon, invited him and the monks to his house the next day. He also invited Sudhamma, but because he had been invited after the others, Sudhamma refused to go. Early the next day he visited Citta’s house to see what offerings had been prepared, and after seeing them, remarked that one thing was missing: sesame cakes. Then Citta rebuked him, comparing him to a crow, the offspring of a cock and a crow. Sudhamma left the house in anger, and going to Sāvatthī, reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha blamed Sudhamma and said that the Saṅgha should pass the paṭisāraṇīyakamma on him. Sudhamma, thereupon, went to Macchikāsaṇḍa to ask pardon of Citta, but Citta would not forgive him. The Buddha then gave him a companion, and together they went to Citta, and Sudhamma again asked pardon for his fault.

               </b>
               <br/>A Licchavi prince of Vesāli. He was, at one time, a member of the Order and the personal attendant of the Buddha, but was later converted to the views of Korakkhattiya and went about defaming the Buddha, saying that he had nothing superhuman and was not distinguished from other men by preaching a saving faith: that the doctrine preached by him did not lead to the destruction of sorrow, etc. Sāriputta, on his alms rounds in Vesāli, heard all this and reported it to the Buddha, who thereupon preached the Mahāsīhanāda Sutta. <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.i.68ff.</c>  The Sunakkhatta Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">MN.ii.252ff.</c>  was evidently preached to Sunakkhatta before he joined the Order, while the Pātika Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.iii.1ff.</c>  gives an account of his dissatisfaction.<br/>His grievance was that the Buddha showed no mystic superhuman wonders, that he had not shown him the beginning of things. The Buddha reminded him that he had not promised to do any of these things, and that, at one time, Sunakkhatta had been loud in his praise of the Buddha and the Dhamma. The Buddha warned him that people would say he had left the Order because its discipline had proved too hard for him. The Buddha had told him that Korakkhattiya, whom he so much admired, would be born after death among the Kālakañjaka Asuras within seven days. It happened as the Buddha prophesied, and the dead body of Kora declared that he was right. But even so, Sunakkhatta was not convinced.<br/>Later he transferred his allegiance to Kandaramasaka, who died, as the Buddha had prophesied, fallen from grace and fame. The next teacher to win the admiration of Sunakkhatta was Pātikaputta, and Sunakkhatta wished the Buddha to pay honour to him. But the Buddha quoted to Sunakkhatta the words of Ajita, the Licchavi general who had been born in Tāvatiṃsā, to the effect that Pātikaputta was “a liar and a cheat,” and was later able to prove that these words were true. But Sunakkhatta did not return to the Order. He had probably remained in it for several years before actually leaving it. For we find in the Mahāli Sutta <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.152</c>  the Licchavi Oṭṭhaddha relating to the Buddha how Sunakkhatta had come to him three years after joining the Order, claiming that he could see divine forms but could not hear heavenly sounds. The Sutta itself gives <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.153</c>  as the reason that he had only developed one sided concentration of mind.<br/>

Once, when he was performing Fire-rites on the banks of the Sundarikā, he looked round to see if there were anyone, to whom he could give what was left over from the oblations. He saw the Buddha seated under a tree, his head covered; he approached him with the oblation and a water pitcher and addressed him. The Buddha uncovered his head. The sight of the shaven head at first made Sundarika draw back, but, realizing that some brahmins too were shaved, he questioned the Buddha about his birth. The Buddha explained to him that the important thing was not birth, but the leading of a good life. The brahmin was pleased and offered him the oblation, but the Buddha refused it, saying that he did not accept presents for chanting verses. He advised Sundarika to throw the food into the water, where there were no creatures, for who could digest food which had once been offered to a Buddha? The brahmin followed this advice and saw the water hiss and seethe with steam and smoke. Alarmed and with hair on end, he worshipped the Buddha, who preached to him. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.i.167f.</c>  The account of the meeting between the Buddha and Sundarika is given in the Sutta Nipāta too, <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.p.79f.</c>  but there the details differ greatly, though the topic of discussion is the same.

The Buddha answered that purity was not to be won that way and preached to him the Vatthūpama Sutta.<br/>

Sujāta then determines to go to Mithila to see the Buddha and go forth. When Sundarī’s mother heard the news, she implored Sundarī to remain as the heir to the family, but Sundarī was also committed to the Dhamma. She went to the Buddha and roared a Lion’s Roar.<br/>

               </b> (1)  Sundarikā<br/>A Paribbājikā. She listened to the persuasions of her colleagues, the heretics, and would be seen in the evenings going towards Jetavana with garlands, perfumes, fruits, etc. When asked where she was going, she would reply that she was going to spend the night in the Buddha’s cell. She would then spend it in a neighbouring monastery of the Paribbājakas and be seen again early in the morning coming from the direction of Jetavana. After some days, the heretics hired some villains to kill Sundarī and hide her body under a heap of rubbish near Jetavana. Then they raised a hue and cry and reported to the king that Sundarī was missing. A search was made, and her body was found near the Gandhakuti of the Buddha. Placing the body on a litter, they went about the streets of the city crying— “Behold the deeds of the Sākyan monks!” As a result, the monks were subjected to great insults in the streets. For seven days the Buddha stayed in the Gandhakuti, not going to the city for alms, and Ānanda even suggested that they should go to another city.<br/>But the Buddha pointed out to him the absurdity of running away from a false report, and said that in seven days the truth would be known. The king employed spies, who found the murderers quarrelling among themselves after strong drink. They were seized and brought before the king, where they confessed their crime. The king sent for the heretics and compelled them to retract their accusations against the Buddha and his monks and to confess their own wickedness. They were then punished for murder. <c c="#3b6bd3">Ud.iv.8</c>

Sakka sent a squall to punish the deva and made the deva appear before him full of repentance. Then Sakka warned him to keep the Rukkhadhamma, which was that various people take and make use of various parts of a tree; it is not for the deva of the tree to mope and pine on that account. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.369f.</c>

While waiting the departure of the crowd so that he could pay homage to the Buddha and express his gratitude, Sakka, desiring to test him, approached him and offered him untold wealth if he would repudiate the Buddha, his teachings, and the Order. But although Sakka revealed his identity, Suppabuddha rebuked him for a fool and said he had no need of more wealth, because he possessed already the seven stores of Noble Wealth. Sakka reported this conversation to the Buddha, who said that no power in the world would change Suppabuddha.

She therefore, with a knife, cut a piece of flesh from her thigh and gave it to her servant to make into soup for the monk. She then went to her room and lay on her bed. When Suppiya returned and discovered what had happened he was overjoyed, and, going to the monastery, invited the Buddha to a meal the next day. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and when, on the next day, he arrived with his monks, he asked for Suppiyā. On hearing that she was ill, he desired that she be brought to see him. At the moment when the Buddha saw her wound was healed, covered with good skin, on which grew fine hairs as on the rest of her body.<br/>It was as a result of this incident that the Buddha lay down a rule forbidding monks to eat human flesh, even when willingly given. <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.216f.</c>

Having heard that the Buddha would die in the third watch of the night, Subhadda went to the sāla grove, where the Buddha lay on his death bed, and asked Ānanda for permission to see him. But three times Ānanda refused the request, saying that the Buddha was weary. The Buddha overheard the conversation and asked Subhadda to come in. Subhadda asked the Buddha if there were any truth in the teachings of other religious instructors. The Buddha said he had no time to discuss that, but that any system devoid of the Noble Eightfold Path was useless for salvation, and he taught Subhadda the Doctrine. Subhadda asked to be allowed to join the Order, and the Buddha gave Ānanda special permission to admit him at once without waiting for the usual probationary period. Subhadda dwelt in solitude and in meditation and soon became an arahant. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.ii.148ff.</c>

               <br/>A brahmin of Aṅguttarāpa. He was a great friend of Keṇiya, the Jaṭila, and visited him when Keṇiya was making preparations to entertain the Buddha. Having heard the word “Buddha” from Keṇiya, Sela was filled with joy and fortitude, and went with his two hundred and fifty pupils to visit the Buddha in the woodland near Apana. There he observed on the person of the Buddha the thirty two marks of a Great Being all except two—viz., hidden privates and the long tongue. The Buddha read his thoughts and contrived, by his iddhi power, that Sela should be satisfied on these two points as well. Sela then praised the Buddha in a series of verses and asked questions of him. At the end of his talk, Sela entered the Order with his pupils, and, at the end of a week, he attained arahantship. <c c="#3b6bd3">Snp.p.104ff.</c>

He lived in great luxury in three palaces, each for its own season. King Bimbisāra, hearing of him, sent for him and Soṇa went with eighty thousand fellow townsmen.<br/>In Rājagaha he heard the Buddha preach, and, winning faith, entered the Order with his parents’ consent. The Buddha gave him a subject for meditation, and he went to Sītavana, but many people visited him and he was unable to concentrate. He strove hard, and, through pacing up and down in meditation, painful sores developed on his feet. But he won no attainment and was filled with despair. The Buddha saw this and taught him that when he was a vīṇā player his vīṇā sounded neither tuneful nor playable when the strings were either over-strung or over-lax. Even so, energy, when over-strung, ends in flurry, when over-lax, in idleness. Soṇa profits by the lesson and becomes an arahant. He then visits the Buddha and declares to him his new found vision. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.374f.</c>

               <br/>The Vinaya <c c="#3b6bd3">Vin.i.179ff.</c>  gives details of Soṇa’s visit to Bimbisāra. The king, being curious to see Soṇa’s feet, sent for him. He and his eighty-thousand companions went to see the Buddha, and there they were greatly impressed by the iddhi-power of Sāgata. Soṇa then sought the Buddha alone and joined the Order. After ordination he walked about meditating, his feet bled, and his cankamana was covered with blood “like a slaughter house for oxen.” After Soṇa attained arahantship, the Buddha gave him permission to wear shoes with one lining. Soṇa said he had abandoned eighty cartloads of gold and a retinue of seven elephants. He did not wish, as a monk, to have any luxuries which his colleagues did not share. The Buddha then gave permission to all monks to wear shoes with one lining.<br/>

At the end of the discourse, Soṇadaṇḍa expressed his appreciation of the Buddha and his doctrine, and invited him and his monks to a meal. At the conclusion of the meal Soṇadaṇḍa asked the Buddha to forgive him if, in the presence of the brahmins, he did not make humble obeisance to the Buddha, but merely saluted him. <c c="#3b6bd3">DN.i.111ff.</c>

               </b> (2)  Āḷavaka<br/>An eminent lay disciple of the Buddha declared foremost among those who gather a following by means of the four bases of sympathy. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.26</c>  The books record several conversations between the Buddha and Hatthaka. He once saw the Buddha at Gomagga in Siṃsapāvana, near Alavi, and asked him if he were one of those who lived happily. The Buddha said he was always happy in any circumstances. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.136f.</c>  On another occasion the Buddha asked Hatthaka how he could command the allegiance of such a large company. “By the four bases of sympathy,” he answered, by giving gifts, by kindly words, by kindly deeds, by equality of treatment. And when Hatthaka had gone, the Buddha praised him for his eminence, in that he possessed eight marvellous qualities: faith, virtue, conscientiousness, fear of blame, ability to listen well, charity, wisdom, modesty. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.218f.</c>  
               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iv.216</c> 
               <br/>Together with Cittagahapati, Hatthaka is often held up as an example to be copied by others. <c c="#3b6bd3">SN.ii.235</c>

               <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.iii.451</c> 
               <br/>After death, Hatthaka was born in Avihā, there to pass away entirely. From there he once visited the Buddha and tried to stand in his presence, but collapsed and could not remain upright. The Buddha then asked him to create a gross body form, and when he did this he was able to stand. He told the Buddha that he was constantly surrounded by devas wishing to learn the Dhamma from him, and confessed that he had died regretting three things: of not having seen enough of the Buddha, of not heard enough of the Dhamma, of not served enough the Saṅgha. <c c="#3b6bd3">AN.i.278f.</c>
