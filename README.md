# Glossaries for Buddhist Studies


This repository provides glossaries for Buddhist Studies. I use them in [GoldenDict](http://goldendict.org), but other offline dictionary platforms like StarDict, AppleDict, Pleco, QuickDic, will be able to read some of them.
They come in different formats like xdxf, bgl, and StarDict's .idx/,ifo etc. (To convert into other formats I recommend [pyglossary](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary)).
The glossaries here are distributed under a Creative Commons 0 (1.0 Universal) License.
Currently included here:

* "DILA_persAuthority20XX-XX.dict.xdxf.zip": Dictionary version of the Dharma Drum [Buddhist Person Name Authority](http://authority.dila.edu.tw/person/). Contains information (in Chinese) on c.42,000 East Asian and some Indian Buddhists. I update this occasionally as the database evolves. 

* "dppn_suttacentral.xdxf": Based on material from Malalasekera's Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names. Entries on c. 1,360 person and place names from Pāli sources (only about 15% of Malalasekera). This glossary was created from data retrieved March 2020 from the [SuttaCentral repository](https://github.com/suttacentral/sc-data/tree/master/dictionaries/en). The file distributed by SuttaCentral added information by geo-referencing places, and classes (person, place, thing).

* "Yokoyama-Hirosawa1996.zip": Two versions of a Sanskrit-Chinese-Tibetan glossary created from an index to the Yogācārabhūmi. Print original: Koitsu YOKOYAMA, Takayuki HIROSAWA: Index to the Yogācārabhūmi. Tokyo: Sankibo, 1996. Babylon glossary format. "Yokoyama.1996.瑜伽师地论汉藏梵索引_sanTibChin.gls" is converted from a .mdx version found on the Net. Chinese headwords are only in 簡體字. "Yokoyama.1996.瑜珈师地论漢蔵梵索引_chinOnly.gls" is arranged by Chinese headwords in 繁體字. References to actual passages are unfortunately not preserved in either version. To locate a term in a Yogācārabhūmi passage use the print original by Yokoyama and Hirosawa, or try the [Yogācārabhūmi Database](http://ybh.chibs.edu.tw/ui.html).

## Maintained elsewhere:
* Crucial Chinese lookup tools (Unihan, CC-Cedict, Kangxi etc.) and Edgerton's Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary expertly rendered and maintained by Simon Wiles [here](https://simonwiles.net/glossaries/).

* A large number of Sanskrit dictionaries in XDXF have been produced by [GRETIL](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.html#Dictionaries).

* Dharma Drum maintains a website with Buddhist glossaries [for download](http://buddhistinformatics.dila.edu.tw/glossaries/download.php) or [online lookup](http://glossaries.dila.edu.tw/).
