# Glossaries for Buddhist Studies


This repository provides glossaries for Buddhist Studies. I use them in [GoldenDict](http://goldendict.org) but other offline dictionary platforms like StarDict, AppleDict, Pleco, QuickDic, will be able to read some of them.
They come in different formats like xdxf, bgl, and as stardict. To transform into other formats I recommend [pyglossary](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary). 
The glossaries are distributed under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA License.
The following glossaries are currently included here:

* Dictionary version of the Dharma Drum [Buddhist Person Name Authority](http://authority.dila.edu.tw/person/). Contains information on c.42,000 East Asian and some Indian Buddhists (in Chinese). I update this occasionally as the database evolves. 

* Malalasekera's Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names. Entries on c. 1,300 person and place names from Pāli sources. First published in 1938, this was created from data retrieved March 2020 from the [SuttaCentral repository](https://github.com/suttacentral/sc-data/tree/master/dictionaries/en). The file distributed by SuttaCentral added information by geo-referencing places, and classes (person, place, thing).

* A large number of Sanskrit dictionaries in XDXF have been produced by [GRETIL](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.html#Dictionaries).

* Dharma Drum maintains a website with [Buddhist glossaries for download](http://buddhistinformatics.dila.edu.tw/glossaries/download.php) or [online lookup](http://glossaries.dila.edu.tw/).
